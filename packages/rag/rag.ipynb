This lesson tries to explore the\\nmeaning of Political Science. Political Science, traditionally , begins and ends with the state.\\nSo considered, it is the study of the state and government. The modern view of Political\\nScience lays emphasis on its being the study of power and authority . Political Science also\\nexplains its ever-widening scope. Its scope includes study of the state and the study of\\npolitical system; covering the study of government, study of power; study of man and his\\npolitical behaviour and study of political issues  which influence politics directly or indirectly .\\nIn this lesson, you will study some of the core concepts like Justice and its relevance to\\ncitizens.\\nObjectives\\nAfter studying this lesson you will be able to\\n/circle6explain the meaning of Political Science in the light of some standard  definitions;\\n/circle6distinguish between Political Science and Politics;\\n/circle6describe the scope of Political Science in terms of role of the State, functions of\\ngovernment and its relationship with citizens;\\n/circle6recognize the relevance of Justice for citizens and State.\\n1.1  Meaning of Political Science\\nPolitical Science is that part  of social science which deals with the foundations of the state\\nand the principles of the government . According to J W Garner , “Politics begins and ends\\nwith the state.” Similarly , R G Gettel wrote that  Politics is the “study of the state in the\\npast, present and future”. Harold J Laski stated in the same vein that the study of Politics\\nconcerns itself with the life of men and women in relation to organized state. Thus as a\\nsocial science,  Political Science deals with those  aspects of individuals in society which\\nrelate to their activities and or ganizations devoted to seeking of power , resolution of conflicts\\nand all these, within an overall fram ework of the rule and law as laid down by the state.1\\nMEANING  AND SCOPE OF\\nPOLITICAL SCIENCE\\nY'),\n",

That is\\nwhy many commentators, as you saw , rightly define Politics in terms of the state or\\ngovernment. However , this definition does not exhaust the meaning of Politics. Politics\\nalso deals with power . Harold D. Lasswell and Abraham Kaplan define Political Science\\nas “the study of shaping and sharing of power”. In a word, Politics deals with both state\\nand power . However , the power that Political Science deals with is, more often than not,\\nthe legitimate power . Since science is the systematic study of any phenomenon through\\nobservation and experiment, it follows that Political Science studies the state and power in\\nall their aspects. You will learn more about the state and power later in this lesson.\\nPolitical Science deals with both empirical facts and normative issues. Facts are in the\\ndomain of “what is” and value preferences are in the domain of “what should be.” For\\nexample, if somebody says India is a parliamentary democracy , he or she is making a\\nstatement of empirical fact. This is what India today actually is. But if she or he were to\\nmake a statement like the one that India should switch over to presidential form of\\ndemocracy , the statement would be a normative one. Political Science is not satisfied with\\ndescribing the state of affairs, it wants to change or improve upon them. Empirical statements\\nare true or false by virtue of what observation shows to be the case. Evaluative statements\\nare ethical/moral imperatives, which are often said not to be true or false in any sense at\\nall. Formal statements (such as the propositions of mathematics) are true or false by virtue\\nof the meanings of their constituent terms alone. Political Philosophy deals with formal\\nstatements. Political Science deals with empirical statements and also evaluates the existing\\npolitical institutions, practices and focuses on how to improve them.\\nIntext Questions  1.1\\nFill in the blanks :\\n(a) Political Science deals with both .................... and ..................... issues (empirical,\\nnormative, formal).\\n(b) Political Science studies ....................and ....................

Philosophers\\nlike Plato and Aristotle used it in the most comprehensive sense. Aristotle called Politics a\\n“master science”. For him, it comprised of not only the  institutions of state or government\\nbut also family , property and other social institutions. Politics, for the Greeks, was an all-\\nencompassing activity .\\nThe ancient Greek view about Political Science was mainly ethical . In contrast, the ancient'),\n",

But as students of\\nPolitical Science, we know that Politics is much larger than that: it is\\nsystematic study of state and power .\\nAs the state grew in size and became more complex, Political Science acquired a realistic\\nand secular (non-religious) approach. After the Industrial Revolution, the role of the S tate,\\nwhich was limited to maintenance of  law and order and providing defence against external\\naggression, underwent  considerable changes with the emergence of the new economic\\nsystem called capitalism.\\nIn the twentieth century , after the Second World War, the ‘behavioural approach’  offered\\na new dimension of Political Science. The behavioural movement in American Political\\nScience in the 1950s and the 1960s placed a lot of emphasis on the ‘science’ part of\\nPolitics. It wanted to model Politics after the methods followed by natural sciences like\\nPhysics, Botany , etc. The behaviouralists built theory inductively from empirical propositions.\\nThose who follow inductive method would come to the  conclusion after study , observation\\nand experiment. For example, when some behaviouralists saw African-Americans (Blacks)\\nof the southern United S tates of America (USA) voted for the Democratic Party of the\\nUnited S tates, they came to the  conclusion that the African-Americans do vote for the\\nDemocrats.\\nThis behavioural approach shifted the focus of its study from political institutions and\\nstructures to their functions. It placed stress on political activity and the behaviour of men\\nand women who control these institutions. It replaced the study of ideas by the study of\\nfacts, evidence and behaviour . It considered political activity manifested in behaviour as\\nthe true subject of  Political Science.\\nA political activity may be in the form of an individual contesting an election. It may be the\\nactivity of a group seeking the adoption of a particular policy in its favour by the government.\\nAs different people pursue different interests, such activities tend to generate disagreement,\\ncompetition and conflict. But the distinctive quality of Politics is that it includes physical\\ncoercion or force by the government. It may and usually does involve the persuasive\\ninfluence and effort of the government to resolve conflicts through its balanced policy\\ndecisions.\\nPolitics is also viewed as a process whereby individuals, groups or communities seek to\\nachieve their specific but conflicting goals. Politics, as the process, seeks to allocate\\nresources (Easton calls it, values) authoritatively .\\nPolitics, as the study of structures, institutions, processes and activities, recognizes the\\npossibility of the use of power . The Marxist approach, which is derived from the writings\\nof the nineteenth c entury German philosopher Karl Marx, views Politics as a study of\\nirreconcilable conflicts between the two classes ‘haves’  (those who have private property ,\\nor simply the rich) and the ‘have-nots’  (those who do not have any private property , or\\nsimply the poor); in other words, the exploiters and the exploited. The emancipation of the\\nhave-nots will come o nly through a revolution which would put an end to the institution of\\nprivate property , thus changing the class society to the classless society . But Politics, as\\nagainst the Marxist view , has another view also, the liberal view , according to which'),\n",

Incidentally , the Marxist view of politics comes as a reaction to\\nthe liberal view of politics.\\n1.2 Distinction between Political Science and Politics\\nThe terms ‘Political Science’  and ‘Politics’  are often used interchangeably . However , the\\ndistinction between the two needs to be understood. Some scholars define Politics to be\\n“the science and art of government.” But this is only a part of the total explanation of the\\nsubject of Political     Science. Now-a-days the term Politics is used to mean the problems\\nof the citizens interacting with the instrument of political power in one form or the other .\\nSometimes, Politics was and still is used as the technique of compromise or the method to\\ncapture power and retain it.\\nAccording to many political scientists, the study of Political Science comprises theory of\\nthe state, concept of sovereign power , forms and functions of government, making and\\nexecution of laws, elections, political parities, rights and duties of citizens, policy functions\\nand study of welfare activities of the State and government.\\nThere is another aspect of Politics that needs to be emphasised. Politics, many a time,\\nimplies practical politics. Practising politics is different from studying it. Practical politics\\nincludes actual formation of government, the working of government, administration, laws\\nand legislation. It also includes international politics including matters such as peace and\\nwar, international trade and economic order , protection of rights, etc. All these also comprise\\nthe subject matter of the study of   Politics.\\nWhile the knowledge of Political Science as a discipline is acquired through study , the skill\\nof practical politics is acquired through politicking or manipulations and craftiness or by\\nexploiting caste and   regional loyalties and religious sentiments. Practical politics is often\\ndescribed as the ‘dirty game’  and a ‘corrupting’  process in the common people’ s mind.\\nBut we find that there are hardly any human groupings or societies, which are free from\\n‘politic s’ and hardly any individual who does not know the implications of the “game of\\npolitics”.\\nPractical Politics also has many positive aspects. In this era of welfare state many positive\\nprogrammes such as removal of untouchability , land reforms, release of bonded labourers,\\nprohibition of trafficking in human beings and begar  (forced labour), introduction of\\nminimum wages, employment generation programmes, empowerment of the other backward\\nclasses are all examples of positive aspects of practical politics.\\n‘Politics’ refers to the process of actual happenings in society and in institutions, which\\nPolitical Science refers to its understand in a systematic manner .\\nIntext Questions  1.2\\nFill in the blanks :\\n(a)  .................... called Political Science a ‘master science’  (Plato, Aristotle, Laski).\\n(b) Behaviouralism stressed on the .................... part of Political Science (science,\\nphilosophy , political)'),\n",

(honesty , morality ,\\ncraftiness).\\n1.3 Scope Of Political Science\\nHere we shall learn about the scope of Political Science in terms of role of the State,\\nfunctions of government and its relationship with citizens.\\n1.3.1 Role of the S tate\\nThe term ‘State’ in its modern sense was first used by Machiavelli (1469-1527), the Italian\\nstatesman. The study of the State has since remained the focal point for the political\\nscientists.\\nThe State consists of four elements. These are: (a) the people; (b) the territory on which\\nthey live; (c) the government to rule and regulate the lives of the people and (d) sovereignty ,\\nwhich implies unrestricted authority to take decisions and   manage its own af fairs. You\\nwill read in detail about these four elements in the second lesson.\\nThe role and nature of the S tate have been interpreted dif ferently . Modern western liberal\\nthinking, about which you will study more in the fourth lesson, arose with the commerial\\n(Mercantile) Revolution in Western Europe in the sixteenth century and became prominent\\nwith the Industrial Revolution in the eighteenth century . These Revolutions brought into\\nfocus a new economic system called capitalism.\\nMarket is a place where goods and services are sold and bought. It operates\\non the basis of demand and supply . Many people r egard it as a self-r egulating,\\nself-correcting place, provided there is no interference by the state.\\nCompetition is the chief hallmark of market. Capitalism and market are\\nconsidered two sides of the same coin.\\nThe social group consisting of traders, merchants and businessmen and later the industrialists\\n(also known as the bourgeois) was the major beneficiary of this system. The liberals\\nemphasized that the consent of the people is the true basis of the state. Early liberal\\nthinkers also considered the state as a  ‘necessary evil’- an evil but necessary for the\\npurpose of protecting the individual from the external and internal enemies. According to\\nthis view , that government is the best which governs the least. In other words, the state\\nshould be a ‘police state’ and hence a limited one. It should also be limited in a  different\\nsense: as John Locke, the famous English liberal philosopher of the seventeenth century ,\\nsaid it is there to protect the individual’ s natural right to life, liberty and property .\\nRights are claims by an individual on the state. Natural rights are those\\nrights with which an individual is supposed to have been born. These are, so\\nto say , God-given rights. Mor e impor tantly , individual is supposed to have\\nacquired them even before the state came into existence. The important\\nimplication is that since the state has no role in the creation or granting of\\nthese rights, it cannot take away or abridge these rights.\\nBy contrast, the Marxist view , about which you will study more in the fourth lesson, does'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Hp\\\\Documents\\\\vscode\\\\prepbridge\\\\prepbridge\\\\data\\\\indian-polity.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content='MODULE - 1\\nNotes\\n6Meaning and Scope of Political Science\\nIndividual and the S tate not consider the State as an impartial institution. It asserts that, throughout the centuries,\\nthe state has been a tool in the hands of the “haves” for exploiting and dominating the\\n“have-nots.” In the future classless society like the communist society , the state would\\n“wither away ,”. In Gandhian view , the S tate would justify its existence, by acting as a\\n“trustee” of the people. It should help the poorest and the weakest one. It should restore\\nto him or her , a control over his or her own life and destiny .\\nThe Welfare S tate, which slowly emer ged during the 1930s, tries to promote the well\\nbeing of its citizens, especially the poor , the needy , the unemployed and the aged. It is now\\ngenerally agreed that the Welfare S tate exists to promote common good. So the functions\\nof the state have increased manifold.\\nThe state to act as ‘trustee’  of the people means that it should hold people’ s\\npower as a trust for welfare of the people. It should not consider people as\\nhelpless subjects, but as co-rulers in its governance.\\nPower refers to  the ability of one person af fecting the attitudes or action of another . I have\\npower over you if I can make you do what you would not have done otherwise. But power\\nis not always exercised openly . It can be exercised in unseen way , as in controlling the\\nagenda. However , power can be best exercised when I can convince you about what is\\ngood/bad for you. To that extent, my power over you would be complete. And this\\ndominance would always go unchallenged.\\nBy power of the government, we think of the dif ferent aspects of government. We think\\nof ministers who have departments under them for the exercise of power over the area of\\ntheir domains. There is the bureaucracy and the enormous structure of governmental\\nadministration, which has power over us. It can control our lives in various ways by making,\\nadministering and implementing laws.\\nHere, one thing is to be noted. Power does not lie only in the highly publicized areas of\\nsocial life, like government, administration, elections, etc. It also exists in small institutions\\nlike family etc.Many feminists are of the opinion that inside the private world of family\\nman exercises power or dominance over woman. Hence, it is very aptly said, “even the\\npersonal is political.”\\nAnother thing to be noticed is that there is a distinction between legitimate and illegitimate\\npower . There can be power , which is considered right or proper , while another may be\\nimproper . A dacoit’ s power over me is very real, because if I do not comply with his\\nwishes, I might lose my life or limb. But it is not proper power as is generally understood.\\nContrary to it the power that the government’ s representatives, policemen or judges exercise\\nover me is proper power . The dacoit’ s power is illegitimate power while the government’ s\\nis  legitimate. And the power of constitutional authorities over me is called authority . Authority\\ncontains the two ideas of power and legitimacy . Authority is that form of power which is\\nlegitimate. It is power plus ligitimacy .\\n1.3.2 Citizens and Government\\nThe government is the most important instrument of the State through which the latter\\nrealizes its objectives. Through its three organs i.e; the Legislature, the Executive and the'),\n",

It also tries to ensure territorial integrity or unity\\nof the country .\\nModern democratic governments perform many other functions for the development and\\nwelfare of citizens and the society , as a whole. This is especially so in a developing country\\nlike ours.\\nThe relationship between citizens and the government is reciprocal. The citizens are\\nmembers of the State. The state recognizes certain rights of the citizens and in turn expects\\ncertain duties from them.\\nSo far as the rights of the citizens are concerned, they can be divided into three: civil,\\npolitical and social. CIVIL RIGHTS  are those rights which are necessary for the freedom/\\nliberty of the individual. They include the right to life and personal liberty , right to freedom\\nof speech, expression and thought, right to own   property , right to enter into contract, right\\nto   equality before law and equal protection by law . Equality before law means absence of\\nspecial privileges; equal protection of laws implies equals should be treated equally .\\nPOLITICAL RIGHTS  include the right to vote and the right to contest election. SOCIAL\\nRIGHTS  include the right to some degrees of economic welfare and security and the right\\nto live the life of a civilized being according to standards prevailing in the society .\\nIt is the primary duty of the citizens to pay taxes to the government. They should co-\\noperate with the government and abide by the laws and rules; should help in preventing\\ndiseases by immunization and by keeping neighborhood clean. They should have small\\nfamilies to help the government check the population growth. They should preserve public\\nproperty , help in catching and punishing anti-social and anti-national elements. Further , the\\ncitizens of different castes, religions, languages and regions should solve their problems by\\nunderstanding and agreement and not by violent means. In this way , a lot of resources,\\nenergy and time of the government can be saved for constructive purposes.\\n1.3.3 Liberty\\nThe term liberty is derived form the Latin word liber  meaning free. Thus liberty means\\nfreedom. Freedom is of paramount importance for the   development of an individual’ s\\npersonality . Historically speaking, the term liberty was initially defined as absence of all\\nrestraints on an individual. This is known as the negative concept of liberty . Early liberalism\\nchampioned negative liberty . John S tuart Mill, the nineteenth century English political\\nphilosopher , described, “Restraint as an evil”. Mill was especially worried about the\\nrestraints coming from the state and society .\\nHowever , since individuals live together in a society , complete absence of restraints would\\nbe neither possible nor desirable. Further , differentiating between the self-regarding and\\nother-regarding action  is not always possible. It has been very aptly said that your liberty\\nto swing your arm ends there where my nose begins. For liberty to be enjoyed by everyone,\\nit should have reasonable restraints. This is the concept of positive liberty . This concept\\nfurther means freedom to be a master of one’ s own self.  Harold J Laski supported this\\nconcept. Freedoms are opportunities which history has shown to be essential to the\\ndevelopment of personality . The freedom of many requires restraint of law on the freedom\\nof some. Later liberals supported the positive liberty .'),\n",

This way the government can be    prevented from encroaching upon\\nthe freedoms of the people.\\nImpartial judiciary is rightly called the watchdog of liberty . Without it the liberty of the\\nindividuals would be meaningless.\\nDecentralization of powers is another important safeguard of liberty . History is witness to\\nthe fact that concentration of power has very often led to despotism.\\nSeparation of powers, i.e. the executive, the legislature and the judiciary being separate, is\\na great ally of liberty . Montesquieu said, “Power should be a check on power .”\\nRule of law or equality in the eyes of the law is also an important safeguard of liberty . This\\nis the bulwark against discrimination based on caste, class, colour , creed, etc.\\nA large measure of social justice or diffusion of social and economic privileges is a\\nprerequisite for liberty . If privileges become the prerogative of the select few , then ef fective\\nliberty would be denied to a vast majority .\\nA well-knit party system is also indispensable for the preservation of liberty .\\nAll these institutional safeguards are inadequate to preserve liberty if the citizens themselves\\ndo not possess the proud spirit to preserve it. People should always be on their toes to\\nensure that their liberty is not encroached upon. Eternal vigilance, it has been rightly said,\\nis the price of liberty .\\nIntext Questions 1.3\\nFill in the blanks :\\n(a) The term ‘State’ was first used by ....................

Thus the word\\nJustice means joining or fitting.  “Justice”, says E Barker , “is the reconciler and the synthesis\\nof political values.”'),\n",

Herein comes the concept of distributive Justice – what is the pr oper\\nway of distribution of income or social position in a given society . There are two\\nmajor conceptions of distributive/social Justice, one involves the notion of merit and the\\nother involves need and equality .\\n1.4.2 Merit\\nThe first conception ar gues that each person’ s social position and (material) wealth must\\nbe decided on the basis of merit. When people talk of careers open to talents and equality\\nof opportunity , they have merit in view . However , the question arises as to how to measure\\nmerit or talent? The liberals say that the price that someone can command in a free\\nmarket is the reasonable indicator of his/her value to others. The socialist critics are of the\\nopinion that market receipts are often affected by chance and social background which\\nhave nothing to do with merit.\\n1.4.3 Need and Equality\\nThe second conception views that goods, positions, etc. should be allocated on the basis of\\na person’ s needs. But how to define needs? Everybody  agrees on food, shelter and\\nclothing. Beyond this, there is no agreement. Communism (Marxism) believes that each\\nperson should define his needs and sufficient resources can be created under communism\\nto meet all the needs of all individuals. However , others are of the opinion that needs can\\nbe satisfied by two agencies – welfare state and the market. Some needs can be satisfied\\nthrough the welfare state and others being allocated through the market.\\n1.4.4 Equality of Opportunity\\nEquality does not mean identity of rewards or identity of treatment, i.e. same reward or\\ntreatment for everybody , regardless of ef forts and circumstances. For example, there\\nwould be no equality if all the students were awarded sixty marks regardless of the quality\\nof answer . Ideally , those who write better should get higher marks. And this is compatible\\nwith equality . Likewise, in a society some people have more income and some have less.\\nHowever , this state of af fairs does not violate equality provided two conditions are met:\\n(a) absence of privileges  and  (b) equality of opportunity\\n(a) Absence of privileges strengthens equality; the existence of privileges would,\\nconversely , promote inequality . This means that no one be given facilities/opportunities\\nmore than those given to others. Privileges create a situation of inequality , and in the\\nprocess, harms equality .\\n(b) Equality of opportunity means everybody should have the same chance to access\\npublic position and of fice. An example of the working of the equality of opportunity\\nin India is the Civil  Services examination conducted by the Union Public Services\\nCommission (UPSC). Any Indian graduate from any university of India can take the\\nexamination.\\nAllied to the concept of equality of opportunity is equality of (starting) conditions .'),\n",

Some would come first, some, second and others would fail. But this would not be\\na violation of equality . Many people are  convinced that  equality of conditions can only be\\nachieved when the historically disadvantaged groups (like the Dalits/the Scheduled Castes)\\nare  compensated through reservation of jobs or (as is known in the United States of\\nAmerica) affirmative action.\\nEquality is closely connected to equity , i.e., even-handed treatment. Equity demands like\\ncases to be treated alike. Relevantly similar cases are to be treated in similar ways.\\n1.4.5 Overall Results (Communitarian Justice)\\nThere is the other kind of theory of Justice that does not take either merit or need into\\naccount. It takes into account the overall results. John Rawls’  theory belongs to this category .\\nIn his book A Theory of Justice he argues that inequalities in the allocation of goods are\\npermissible if and only if those  inequalities work to the benefit of the least well-off\\nmembers of society . In other words, a society having income inequality is just if and only\\nif that inequality benefitted the least advantaged members of that society . For example, a\\nprofessor ’s higher salary can be just if and only if it, directly or indirectly , benefits, so to\\nsay, the bricklayer .\\nOn the other hand, scholars like Nozick argue in favour of traditional meaning of Justice:\\nas respect for law and entitlements . Entitlements mean established/ conventional rights.\\nAccording to this theory , individuals have natural rights, especially the right to property .\\nThese entitlements accrue to the individuals because they are human beings. Nozick says\\nnobody , not even the state, can override these entitlements. Putting simply , Nozick is ar guing\\nagainst excessive taxation imposed by the (welfare) state. He thinks that taxation interferes\\nwith rights of the individual to dispose of the income as she or he  thinks fit. Taxation is an\\ninstance of curtailment of liberty of the individual.\\nJustice is a dynamic concept. It has been undergoing changes from the ancient times till\\ntoday . So no final word can be said about Justice. Justice is concept which keeps evolving.\\n1.4.6. Justice and its Relationship with Liberty and Equality\\nThe nineteenth century scholars like Lord Acton and Alexis de Tocqueville  considered\\nliberty and equality as incompatible. They thought that too much of stress on equality\\nwould lead to the dilution of liberty . Many later scholars also agreed with them. Progressive\\ntaxation by the welfare state was considered   violative of the liberty of the propertied\\npeople. However , it remained a fact that proceeds of tax went towards financing the\\nprogrammes to ameliorate the plight of the poor , the unemployed, the needy , the handicapped\\nand the aged. A largely egalitarian society was made possible by these programmes. In\\ntimes of conflict like this, prevailing notion of Justice decides what should be the right mix\\nof liberty and equality . Thus freedom and equality are two aspects of Justice. The ultimate\\nobjective of both freedom and equality is Justice.\\nIntext Questions 1.4\\nFill in the blanks :\\n(a) According to........................

The ancient Gr eeks thought of Political Science as Political Philosophy . They laid\\nstress on the ethical aspects of Politics. During the Middle Ages, Political Science\\nbecame a branch of the Church, subordinating political authority to the authority of\\nthe Church.\\n2. In modern times, Political Science acquired a realistic and secular  approach. As a\\nresult of the emergence of capitalism following the Industrial Revolution, the role of\\nthe State underwent considerable changes.\\n3. The subject of Political Science became a specialized science of the state. It studied\\nabout different forms of government and its organs like Legislature, Executive and\\nJudiciary .\\n4. Laski stated that the study of Political Science concerned itself with the life of men\\nor women in relation to organized states.\\n5. In the twentieth century , the behavioural approach shifted the   focus of study from\\npolitical institutions to their functions and to the study of political activities and behaviour\\nof men and women.\\n6. The scope of Political Science includes the study of the role of the State, functions of\\nGovernment and its relationship with    citizens.\\n7. Political Science is distinct from Politics. While the former deals with the study of\\nPolitics, the latter refers to the problems of man and woman which interact with\\npolitical power and conflict with each other .\\n8. Power is the ability to control others. It is the capacity to get things done as one\\nwould like others to do. Power in combination with legitimacy is called authority .\\n9. Generally , freedom is defined as absence of restraints in the behavior of a person.\\nBut positive freedom means self-realization and that individual should be free to act\\nonly to the extent that others’ freedom is not curtailed. Law protects freedom.\\nGenerally it is considered that there is Justice in society if it rewards people on the\\nbasis of merit without being oblivious of the needs of the worst-of f.

The obvious fact is that human beings\\nare  social animals and they cannot live in isolation. They belong to society . The collective\\nlife that they need assumes certain rules and regulations and gradually such a group life\\nhas led to the formation of political communities and the emergence of State. In its earlier\\nform, the State was very simple in its organisation. From that simple organisation it has\\nevolved and grown into the modern complex organization. Over the years it has acquired\\ndifferent forms and has become a reality found everywhere. In this lesson you will read\\nabout the concepts of nation, nationality and state. You will also learn about the elements\\nof State.\\nObjectives\\nAfter studying this lesson, you will be able to\\n/circle6explain the concept of nation and nationality;\\n/circle6make a distinction between nation and nationality;\\n/circle6describe the elements of nationality;\\n/circle6identify the State as a political entity with sovereign power;\\n/circle6explain elements of the State.\\n2.1 Nation And Nationality\\nThe term nationality is  derived from the Latin word natus,  which means ‘to be born’.\\nTherefore in its derivative term, nationality means belonging to the same racial stock or\\nbeing related by birth or having blood relationship. This  understanding of nationality is\\nhowever misleading. There is today not a single nation in the world whose people belong\\nto the same racial stock. Every nation has people of mixed racial background. It is very\\ndifficult to find racial purity because of increased racial combinations due to immigrations,\\ninter-caste and inter-racial marriages. The development of natio nality is definitely more of2\\nNATION AND ST ATE\\nT'),\n",

In the words of J.W . Garner ,\\nnationality is a culturally homogeneous group that is at once conscious of its unity .\\nAccording to Ramsay Muir , a nation may be defined as a body of people who feel themselves\\nto be naturally linked together by certain affinities, which are so strong for them to live\\ntogether , they are dissatisfied when disunited and cannot tolerate subjection to people who\\ndo not share the same ties. The development of nationality is definitely psychological\\nphenomenon or as Hayes says, it is primarily cultural,   conscious of unity .\\n2.2 Distinction between Nation and Nationality\\nThe distinction between the nation and nationality is a thin one. This is more so because\\nboth the terms are derived from the same word. Some even consider them as\\ninterchangeable. But certainly there are differences between the two, which can be summed\\nup as follows:\\n1. Nationality is a cultural term. It is a psychological, which is generated in a group of\\npeople having ge ographical unity and who belong to a common race, common history ,\\nreligion, customs and traditions, economic interests and common hopes and aspirations.\\nThe people of a nationality must have a sense of unity . They must feel that they have\\nsomething in common which differentiates them from other people. But nation is a\\npeople organised; a people united. What unites people in a nation are feelings of\\noneness. Nation gives an idea of an organisation; nationality gives an idea of sentiment.\\n2. Nationality is basically a cultural term; it is ‘political’ only incidentally as Hayes tells\\nus. Nation is basically a political term, cultural only incidentally . This, however , does\\nnot mean that nationality is not political and nation is not cultural/concepts.\\n3. The evolution of the  state has shown that there may be states with more than one\\nnationalities and there may be nationalities spread over more than one states. The\\nformer USSR, as a state, had a considerable number of nationalities; the Korean\\nnationality , to take another example, is spread over two states. Thus a state may or\\nmay not co-exit with  nationality .\\n4. Nation and nationality are distinct terms in yet another sense. Some use the term\\n‘nationality’ to signify the principle or characteristic that creates a nation. This means\\nthat nationality preceds nation. In terms of origin, therefore, they are not at par . The\\nJewish nationality created the Jewish nation.\\n5. If we use the term ‘nation’ to mean a population of the same race, language and\\ntradition, inhabiting the same territory and constituting the larger part of its population,\\nwe may , and in fact, have the Britishers as the nation. If on the other hand, we use\\nthe term ‘nationality’ to mean one of the several distinct ethnic groups scattered over\\nan area and forming but a comparatively a smaller part of its population, we may , and\\nin fact, have the Welsh na tionality; the latter as a nationality becomes a part of the\\nBritish nation.\\nIntext Question 2.1\\nFill in the blanks:\\n1.

The development of nationality is definitely a __________and __________\\nphenomenon.\\n4. Nationality is derived from the Latin word________.\\n2.3 Elements of Nationality\\nIt is very difficult to define nationality in terms of its elements.  It is a psychological\\nconcept or a subjective idea and therefore it is impossible to find out any common quality\\nor definite interest, which is everywhere associated with nationality . We cannot say with\\ncertainty that this particular element makes for a separate nationality . We can at best list\\nout some factors, which are as follows:\\n2.3.1 Common Geography\\nPeople living in a common territory constitute one of the major elements of nationality .\\nThis is because such a people are likely to develop a common culture. This is also the\\nreason why the countries are called as motherland or fatherland. We also see an identity\\nof people with their country . Thus people of  Denmark are called  the Danes, France as\\nthe French, India as the Indians, America as the Americans and so on. But this point\\nshould not be stretched too far . Common territory is not an absolutely essential element of\\nnationality . The Jews were scattered all over the world before the creation of Israel. They\\nhad no common territory , yet they constituted a strong nationality . Similarly , the Poles\\nwere denied their homeland for a long time before 1919 but they were a nationality .\\n2.3.2 Common Race\\nCommon race denotes the idea that a people belonging to a particular nationality belong to\\none group or they have a social unity . Some people suggest that purity of race makes a\\nnationality . This is scientifically wrong. As pointed above, today due to immigrations and\\nintercaste marriages, purity of race has become almost an impossibility . Today this\\nphenomenon has   become a myth. But certainly the belief that one belongs to the same\\nrace, real or fictitious, has contributed to the idea of nationality . The idea of a common\\nrace is also important because it strengthens common language, common traditions and\\ncommon culture.\\n2.3.3 Common language\\nA common language is a medium of communication, which enables the people to express\\ntheir ideas. It is the basis of all the other elements of nationality . A common language not\\nonly means a common literature but also a common heritage of  historical traditions.\\nCommon historical experiences and common traditions as reflected in the literature bind\\ntogether members of a nationality by certain bonds. A common language creates a cohesive\\nsociety . Most of the European nations developed out of a common language as England\\nfrom the English language, France from the French language or Spain from the Spanish\\nlanguage. But this factor is not a necessary one. Today we find many bi-lingual or multi-\\nlingual nationalities. Further , the English language is a global language which is spoken in\\nall parts of the world and it cannot be associated only with England.'),\n",

A common religion is a strong incentive\\nto national feeling. England fought against the Spanish Armada lar gely due to her\\ndetermination to defend Protestantism. However this factor is also not a necessary one.\\nIn fact in modern times, nationalities tend to become multi-religious and under such\\ncircumstances    religion is regarded as a private affair of individual and secularism prevails\\nin the collective life. Further religion cannot always be a cementing factor . The two wings\\nof Pakistan fell apart and Bangladesh was created despite the common religious af finity .\\nReligion, rather , works negatively as a divisive factor in the Indian Sub-Continent, when\\nPakistan came into existence due to the    partition of India.\\n2.3.5 Common political framework\\nThe existence of a common political framework or a State, whether in the past or present,\\nis another element of nationality . People living in a S tate are knit together through the\\nlaws. Living under one common state creates a sense of unity . Various crises like wars\\nfurther develop the feelings of    patriotism. In fact the government also encourages this\\nidea through various methods. As Gilchrist aptly observes that “a nationality lives either\\nbecause it has been a nation, with its own territory and S tate or , because it wishes to\\nbecome a nation with its own territory and State.”\\n2.3.6 Economic factor\\nThe economic activities bring people closer . It has been ar gued that historically , nationality\\nemerged as a result of fusion of various tribes and clans. One cannot think of nationality in\\na primitive society . The Marxists also believe that  nationality emer ged due to economic\\nfactors. According to them nationality had no place in a slave owning or a feudal society\\nand it emerged due to the emergence of capitalist mode of production. Undoubtedly economic\\nfactor is an important element of nationality . It is also an important factor in the maintenance\\nof nationality . But on its own single-handedly , it cannot create a nationality .\\n2.3.7 Common subjugation\\nCommon subjugation has been a dominant factor in the rise of national movements in the\\nAfro-Asian countries. They were invaded by the various European imperialist powers.\\nThe feelings of nationality arose due to common subjugation as it created a feeling of\\noneness among the people. In India, a common Indian nationality arose due to the common\\ncolonial exploitation.\\n2.3.8 Common political aspirations\\nThe will to be a nation is regard ed by some as the principal factor of nationality . Before the\\nFirst World War, the Poles always wanted Poland. Similarly there were many minorities\\nliving in Europe, which desired a separate nationhood. In 1919 at the Paris Peace\\nConference, this was accepted in the principle of self-determination.\\nWhile all the factors mentioned above help in the growth of nationality , none of them is\\nabsolutely essential. In fact nationality is a subjective sentiment which cannot be defined\\nin terms of any objective factor . The presence or absence of any one or more of these\\nfactors does not imply the presence  or absence of the spirit of nationality .'),\n",

But it is wrongly used as\\nsynonym for nation, society , government etc. The term ‘state’  is also used as S tate\\nmanagement, S tate aid and so on. Also as the S tates of Indian union or the fifty S tates that\\nmake the United S tates of America. But in Political Science, we use this term dif ferently;\\nit has a more specific meaning.\\nSome of the definitions of the concept of State are as follows:\\n“The State is the politically organized people of a definite territory”\\n-Bluntschli\\nState is “a community of persons, more or less numerous, permanently occupying a definite\\nportion of territory , independent, or nearly so, of external control, and possessing an or ganized\\ngovernment to which the great body of inhabitants render habitual obedience.”\\n–Garner\\nState is “a territorial society divided into governments and subjects, whether individuals or\\nassociations of individuals, whose relationships are determined by the exercise of this\\nsupreme coercive power .”\\n–Laski\\nState “is a people organized for law within a definite territory”.\\n–Woodrow Wilson\\n“The State is a concept of political science, and a moral reality which exists where a\\nnumber of people, living on a definite territory , are unified under a government which in\\ninternal matters is the or gan of expressing their sove reignty , and in external matters is\\nindependent of other governments.”\\n–Gilchrist\\nHuman beings are social animals and cannot live alon e. When people live together , they\\nfulfill their socials needs. But everybody is not good and kind. There are all sorts of men\\nand women, who exhibit various emotions such as pride, jealousy , greed, selfishness and\\nso on. According to Burke, “Society requires not only the passions of individuals should be'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Hp\\\\Documents\\\\vscode\\\\prepbridge\\\\prepbridge\\\\data\\\\indian-polity.pdf', 'page': 20}, page_content='MODULE  - 1\\nNotes\\n19Nation and S tate\\nIndividual and the S tate subjected, but that even in the mass and body as in the individuals the inclination of men\\nshould be thwarted, their will controlled and their passions brought into subjection.” The\\nbest is to control human perversity through means of political authority . Therefore people\\nare bound by rules of common behaviour . If these are broken then they can be punished.\\nSociety fulfills people’ s need for companionship; the state solves the problem created by\\nthis companionship.\\nThe state exists for the sake of good life. It is an essential and natural institution and as\\nAristotle  said, “The State comes into existence originating in the bare needs of life and\\ncontinues its existence for the sake of good life.”\\nIt is only within a state that an individual can rise to his or her ability . If there is no authority ,\\nno or ganisation and no rules, then society cannot be held together . The state has existed\\nwhere human beings have lived in an or ganized society . The structure of the state has\\nevolved gradually over a long period of time, from a simple to a complex organisation that\\nwe have today .\\nThe essence of state is in its monopoly of coercive power . It has a right to demand obedience\\nfrom the people.\\nHowever , the Marxists believe that state is a class or ganisation, which has been created\\nby the propertied class to oppress and exploit the poor . They refuse to believe that the\\nstate is a natural institution. To them the propertied class created the state and it has\\nalways belonged to them only . Thus, the state is just a means of exploitation. Therefore,\\nthey visualize a situation of classless society or communism in which there will not be any\\nneed of the state. S tate will, thus, wither away .\\nIntext Questions 2.3\\nFill in the blanks:\\n1. The State exists for the sake of ____________life.\\n2.

These are:\\n2.5.1 Population\\nThe S tate i s a human institution. It is the people who make a S tate. Antarctica is not a\\nState as is it is without any human population. The population must be able to sustain a\\nstate. But the question is; how much should be the population?\\nPlato’ s and Aristotle’ s ideals were the Greek City – S tates of Athens and Sparta. Plato\\nfixed the number of people in an ideal state at 5040. Aristotle laid down a general principle'),\n",

Rousseau put the number at 10,000.But it\\nis difficult to fix the size of the people of a state. In modern times we have India and China\\nwhich have huge population and countries like San Marino with a very small population.\\nCountries like former Soviet Union gave incentives to mother of large families. In India,\\nover-population is a big problem while China has enforced a one-child norm. Dictators like\\nMussolini had openly encouraged large population of the state.\\nSo no limit-either theoretical or practical-can be put on population. But it must be enough\\nto constitute governing and governed classes, sufficient to support a political organization.\\nThe population should be in proportion to the available land and resources. It should be\\nremembered that the differences in the size of population, other things remaining the same,\\ndoes not make any difference in the nature of State.\\nThe quality of the population is also important. A state requires healthy , intelligent and\\ndisciplined citizens. They should be possessed with qualities of vitality . The composition of\\npopulation is also very  important. A state with a homogenous people can be governed\\neasily .\\n2.5.2  Territor y\\nJust as every person belongs to a state, so does every square yard of earth. There is no\\nstate without a fixed t erritory . Living together on a common land binds people together .\\nLove for the territory inculcates the spirit of patriotism. Some call their countries as\\nfatherland and some call it motherland. But there is a definite attachment with one’ s\\nterritory .\\nThe territory has to be definite because it ensures exercise of   political authority . Mobile\\ntribals had some sort of political authority but they did not constitute a State because they\\nlacked a fixed land. The Jews were living in different countries and they became State\\nonly with the creation of Israel, which had a definite territory . Without a fixed  territory it\\nwould be difficult to conduct external relations. It is essential for the identification if one\\nstate attempts to conquer the territory of another .\\nThe territory may be small or large. But the state has to have a definite land. It may be as\\nsmall as San Marino, which has an area of 62 Square kilometers, or it may be as large as\\nIndia, USA, Russia or China. The size of a state influences the form of government. For\\nexample, smaller states can have a unitary form of government but for the large states like\\nIndia and the USA, the federal system is relatively suitable.\\nThe quality of land is also very important. If the land is rich in minerals and natural resources,\\nit will make the state economically powerful. It should be able to provide enough food for\\nits people. The S tates of West Asia were insignificant but they acquired prominence after\\nthe discovery of oil. Large territory of a State gives it strategic and military advantage\\nduring the times of war . Mostly the territory of a state is contiguous and compact though\\nthere are exceptions also. Before the creation of Bangladesh, the two wings of Pakistan\\nwere miles apart. Hawaii and Alaska are far away from the main territory of USA.\\nLand, water and airspace comprise the territory of the state. The sovereignty of a state is\\nexercised over its land, its rivers, mountains and plains and airspace above the land. The\\nsea up to a certain limit from the land border is also a part of the territory of a State.'),\n",

The agency created to enforce rules of\\nconduct and ensure   obedience is called government. Government is also the focus of the\\ncommon purpose of the people occupying the definite territory . It is through this medium\\nthat common policies are determined, common affairs regulated and common interests\\npromoted. Without a government the people will lack cohesion and means of collective\\naction. There would be groups, parties and warring associations and  conditions of wars\\nand chaos. So there is a need for common authority and order where people live. This is\\nthe pre-requisite of human life. The state cannot and does not exist without a government,\\nno matter what form a government may assume. The government is a must, though it may\\ntake any form. It may have a monarchy like Bhutan or republic as in India.

India before 15 August 1947 had all the\\nother elements of the state but it lacked sovereignty and therefore it was not a\\nState.Sovereignty is the supreme power by which the state commands and exerts political\\nobedience from its people. A state must be internally supreme and free from       external\\ncontrol. Thus sovereignty has two aspects, internal and external. Internal sovereignty is\\nthe state’ s monopoly of authority inside its boundaries. This authority cannot be shared\\nwith any other state. The state is independent and its will is  unaffected by the will of any\\nother external authority .\\nTherefore every state must have a population, a definite territory , a duly established\\ngovernment and sovereignty . The absence of any of these elements deprives it the status\\nof statehood. So the term generally used for the 28 provinces of Indian Republic at times\\ncreates confusion and as is the case of ‘50 S tates’  in the United S tates of America.\\nIntext Questions 2.4\\nFill in the blanks:\\n1.

Considering the\\ntwo as interchangeable terms lead to the growth of deceptive social and political theories.\\nMaclver rightly warns: “T o identity the social (i.e. the society) with the political (i.e. the\\nstate) is to be guilty of the grossest of all confusions which completely bars any understanding\\nof either society or the state.” In fact, the ancient Greek philosophers (Socrates, Plato and\\nAristotle) did not make distinction between the state and society . For them, polis was both\\nthe city , i.e. the society and the state. The idealists such as Rousseau, a French political\\nphilosopher of the 18th century , also regarded the two as one.\\nThe distinction between the state and the society can be explained as under:\\n(a) Strictly speaking, the state is a political organization; it is society politically organized.\\nSociety , on the other hand, is a social or ganization and has within it, all types of\\nassociations (social, economic, religious, political, cultural and the like). Society is\\nboth broader as well as narrower than the state. It is broader when it is used to\\ndescribe the whole community of mankind; it is narrower when it is used to describe\\na small group of a village.\\n(b) In terms of origin, society is prior to the state. Society may be said to have been born\\nthe day the human life must have begun. But the state did not begin with the society;\\nit must have started at a later stage of social development. Human beings are social\\nbeing first and then political beings.\\n(c) Being prior to the state, society is clearly a natural and therefore, an instinctive\\ninstitution. The state, on the other hand, is artificial, a created institution; its was\\nmade when it was needed. That is one reason that we see the state as a formal and\\nlegal or ganization with its body , its structure. The society , too, is a body , an or ganization;\\nit is not as formal an organization as the state is.\\n(d) The state exists for the society in the same way as a means exists for its end. The\\nstate is, therefore, a means and the society is an end. It is always the means that\\nexists for the end; the end never exists for the means.\\n(e) The state is sove reign: no sovereignty means no state; the society is not sovereign; it\\nexists without being sovereign. As sovereign, the state is supreme over all other\\norganizations, institutions and individuals within its boundaries; as sovereign, the state\\nis independent of all other like states; sovereignity gives the state a separate and\\nindependent existence.\\n(f) The state has to have a definite territory . You have read that definite territory is an\\nessential element of the state. It is, therefore, a territorial organization in so far as it\\nstays on the definite portion of territory: its territorial boundaries are fixed, definite\\nand permanent. Society does have a territory but its territory is not permanent; its\\nplace of operation may extend or may get limited. The Islamic society , for example,\\ntranscends national boundaries. So does the Free Mason Brotherhood.\\n(g) The state has general rules of conduct called the laws; the society , too, has general\\nrules of conduct but they are called rituals, norms, habits and the like. Laws of the\\nstate are written, definite and clear; those of the society , are unwritten, indefinite and\\nvague.'),\n",

The violation of the laws of the state is\\nfollowed by punishment: physical or otherwise or both. The rules of the society , if\\nviolated, lead to social boycott, i.e. social exclusion. The area of the state, we may\\nsay, is the area of that of taking action in case of disobedience; it has power is force.\\nThe area of society , on the other hand, is the area of voluntary cooperation and its\\npower is goodwill; its method is its flexibility .\\nInspite of these distinctions, society and state are closely inter-connected and inter-\\ndependent. Social conduct and the structure of the society must conform to the laws of the\\nstate. The state, on the other hand, must be responsive to the will of the society .\\nIntext Questions 3.1\\nFill in the blanks :\\n1.

An association has, therefore, three features:\\n(a) organization of the people\\n(b) some common/ specific objectives\\n(c) joint efforts.\\nSo understood, family is an association. Its people are organized through ties of blood; all\\nthe members of the family w ork together to attain objects common to the family . The\\nother examples of the association are Cricket Club, the Church, the Red Cross Society ,\\nthe Residents’  Welfare Association and the like. Associations make up the society . The\\nstate is also an association which exists, along with other associations in the society . But\\nthe state as an association is different from other associations. These differences may be\\nexplained as under:\\n(a) All the associations, including even the state, consist of people. But while the\\nmembership of the state is compulsory , that of the other associations is voluntary . A\\nperson has to be a member of a state: no person, as he/ she becomes adult, is a\\nmember of two states; his/ her me mbership of the state is a matter of compulsion.\\nThe membership of an association, say a Church, Cricket Club, the Red Cross Society'),\n",

But a person may be, a member of numerous\\nassociations at the same time. X is a member of the Cricket Club, the Church and\\nthe Residents Welfare Association – all at the same time.\\n(c) All associations function on territory . But while for a state as an association, territory\\nhas to be definite, the other associations do not have permanent territory . The other\\nassociations must have place to conduct their activities but that place need not be\\ndefinite: that place may be Green Avenue today , Blue Avenue the next month. The\\nstate’ s territory does not change, it is fixed for all times.\\n(d) All associations, including the state, exist to perform and achieve certain ends. While\\nfor the state, the purpose is always general (maintenance of law and order for example)\\nfor the other associations, the purpose is usually specific, particular . The Cricket\\nAssociation exists for playing cricket, a specific and a particular purpose. We can\\nsay that the sphere of state’ s activity is all inclusive while that of any other associations,\\nis always limited.\\n(e) The character of the state is national. The character of other associations may be\\nlocal, provincial, national and even international (The Indian National Congress, for\\nexample, is a national political party , and therefore it is of national character). The\\nResidents’  Welfare Association is local in character; the Government Teachers\\nAssociation of Haryana is a provincial association; the United Nations Educational\\nScientific Cultural Or ganization (UNESCO) is international in character .\\n(f) The other associations differ from the state in so far as they are not sovereigns while\\nthe state is. The other associations may be and actually always are autonomous but\\nthey have to work within the rules of the state. The state is sovereign because it is\\nsupreme over all other associations and is independent of all other states.\\n(g) The violation of the state’ s laws is accompanied by punishment like imprisonment.\\nNo other association has the power to punish its members physically . At best they\\ncan only employ pressure or expel a defiant member .\\nThe relationship between the state and other associations is significant in many respects.\\nThe other associations help the state reduce its burden; they perform functions even greater\\nthan those of the state; some of them, (for example, the family , friendship groups, church)\\nhave been in existence much before the state. The state need not take away their powers;\\nit need not dominate them. What at best, the state can do and in fact, should do is that it\\nshould supervise their activities; should co-ordinate their activities, and should see that the\\nother associations function properly within their spheres. Important as these other\\nassociations are in their internal domains and in their functions, they need not override the\\nauthority of the state, and should never challenge the state’ s sovereignty . The state, on the\\notherhand, need to ensure t he other associations their autonomy .'),\n",

(sovereignty ,\\npopulation, fixed territory)\\n3.4 S tate and Government\\nThe government, as you know , is one element of the state. It is the agency through which\\nlaws are made, enforced and those who violate laws, are punished. It is the visible\\nmanifestation of state authority . It consists of all the persons, institutions and agencies\\nthrough which the will of the state is expressed and carried out. Though the state speaks\\nthrough the government, it is proper to differentiate between the two.\\n(a) The state has authority inherent in itself whereas the government has no inherent\\npowers. The government gets its structure, authority and power from the Constitution\\nof the State.\\nThe Constitution being the collection of basic rules, is the fundamental law\\naccording to which the government of a state is organized.\\n(b) The state is a larger entity that includes all the citizens; the government is, relatively\\na smaller unit that includes only those who are employed to perform its functions.\\nWe are all citizens of the state, but we are all not functionaries of the government.\\nGarner writes: “The government is an essential organ or agency of the state but it is\\nno more than the state itself than the board of directors of a corporation is itself the\\ncorporation.”\\n(c) The idea of state is quite abstract. The government is the concretization of the idea\\nof the state. We see the government, not the state.\\n(d) The state is a near permanent institution; it is so because it does not die unless it is\\nattacked and made a part of the other state. The government is temporary; it is so\\nbecause it may change: today’ s rulers may not be tomorrow’ s rulers. To put it the\\nother way , the state may be the same everywhere whereas, the government may\\nvary from one state to another . India, the United S tates, Great Britain and France for\\nexample, are all states. But the governments which work in these states may not be\\nof the same type. In India and Great Britian there is a parliamentary government,\\nwhereas in the United S tates of America there is presidential government.\\nParliamentary Government is a system of government where the legislative\\norgan of the government is closely related to its executive organ; the cabinet\\nis taken from the legislature and is responsible to it, especially to the lower\\nhouse of the legislature.'),\n",

The\\ngovernment only exercises power . The government’ s powers are delegated and\\nderivative; the state’ s powers are real and original.\\n(f) The opposition to the state is dif ferent from the opposition of the government. We\\ncriticize the government; we never condemn the state. The criticism of the state is a\\nrevolt; the criticism of the government is not a rebellion. We would never hear from\\nan Indian that India is bad; but we would usually hear that the policies of the Indian\\nGovernment headed by a political party or a multitude of political parties are bad. It\\nis a crime to condemn one’ s state; it is a duty , in fact it is a right to criticise one’ s\\ngovernment.\\n(g) The government is merely an element of the state. Accordingly , it is one part of the\\nstate. It is a part of the whole (of the state). As a part, the government is not greater\\nthan the whole. When we talk of the state, we talk of the population, the definite\\nterritory , the government and sovereignty . But when we talk of the government, we\\ntalk of one part, one element of the state.\\n(h) The state’ s territory is always definite. It remains unchanged. Its boundaries remain\\nwhere they are. The government’ s territory is never permanent. Muhammad Tughlaq\\nhad changed his capital to a place called Daulatabad. Many governments had changed\\ntheir capitals to London during the World War II, fearing the German attack.\\nIntext Questions 3.3\\nAnswer the following questions. Give one word only:\\n1. Which organ of the government makes laws?\\n2. Which organ of the government enforces laws?\\n3. With whom does sovereignty lay?\\n4. Through which organ does the state express its will?\\n5. If the state is an abstraction, what is its concrete form?\\n3.5 S tate and Nation\\nBy nation, as you know , we mean a historically constituted stable community of people\\nformed on the basis of a common language, territory , economic life and physhological\\nmake up manifested in a common culture. Nation, Bluntschilli says, is “a union of masses\\nof men bound together specially by language and customs into common civilization which\\ngives them a sense of unity”. A nation is a culturally homogeneous social group.\\nNATION  connotes the concept of people who ar e conscious of their  historical\\nand cultural background and who wish to perpetuate this background\\npolitically , i.e. within the framework of a state .'),\n",

The nation is a group of people\\npsychologically bound together while sharing common joys and sorrows. The distinction\\nbetween state and nation can be explained as under:\\n(a) Nation and state are distinct entities. A nation may not be always a state; India was\\nnot a state before August, 1947. A state may not always be a nation. Austria -\\nHungary was a state but not a nation before World War I because the heterogeneous\\npeople did not form a culturally homogeneous people.\\n(b) The state is a state because it is sovereign. The nation is not a state if it is not\\nsovereign. Sovereignty is the chief characteristic of a state; it is not a feature of the\\nnation. A nation becomes a nation-state when the nation attains statehood.\\n(c) The state is a political concept while the nation is a cultural, and a psychological\\nbody . Hayes says, “Nation is primarily cultural, and only incidentally political”. What\\nit means is that nation is not a political concept, it is only spiritual.\\n(d) Laws bind the people together in a state; sentiments and emotions bind the people in\\na nation. The unity of the state is always external; the unity of the nation is eternal.\\nIn the case of the state, unity is imposed; it comes from above through laws. In the\\ncase of nation, unity comes from within, through emotions.\\n(e) There is an element of force connected with the state. The state’ s laws are binding.\\nThere is a coercion exercised by the state if its authority is defied. In the case of the\\nnation, there is the element of persuasion.\\n(f) The elements of the state are definite: population, fixed territory , government and\\nsovereignty . The elements of a nation are not definite. Somewhere common language\\nhelps constitute a nation, somewhere else, common race makes a nation. Common\\nreligion, for example, was a factor in making Pakistan as a nation; it was common\\nlanguage in the case of the United States as a nation whereas it was common heritage\\nthat made India a nation.\\n(g) A state may be larger than a nation. The former USSR had, within it, more than a\\nhundred nationalities. Conversely , a nation may be lar ger than a state; a nationality\\nmay spread over two states. The Korean nationality is spread over two states: North\\nKorea and South Korea.\\nIntext Questions 3.4\\nFill in the blanks:\\n1.

Its roots can be traced to the days of the\\nsixteenth century . Since then it has passed through numerous stages. The Western\\nEnlightenment had refused to accept moral goals as absolute truths; the English Glorious\\nrevolution (1688) had denounced the divine rights of the kings;\\nThe French Revolution gave the cardinal ideas of ‘Liberty , Equality , and Fraternity’  and\\nthe American War of Independence a little earlier (1775-76) laid emphasis on the declaration\\nof human rights.\\n4.1.1 Meaning of Liberalism\\nHarold Laski, an English scholar of Political Science once wrote: “It (liberalism) is not\\neasy to describe, much less to define, for it is hardly less a habit of mind than a body of\\ndoctrine”. What it means is that liberalism is too dynamic and too flexible a concept to give\\nit a precise meaning. And yet the scholars have made attempts to define it. Sartori says,\\n‘Very simply , liberalism is the theory and practice of individual liberty , juridical defense and\\nthe constitutional state.” According to Koerner , “Liberalism begins and ends with the\\nideals of individual freedom, individual human rights and individual human happiness”.\\nEncyclopaedia Britannica defines liberalism “as an idea committed to freedom, as a method\\nand policy in government, as an organizing principle in society and as a way of life for the\\nindividual and the community .”\\nLiberalism is a theory of reforms, for it has stood for reforms in economic, social and\\npolitical fields. It is a theory of liberty , individual liberty , individual autonomy , for it has\\nargued in favour of the development of human personality . It is a theory of democracy , for\\nit has favoured constitutional government, government based on the consent of the people,\\nrule of law , decentralization, free and fair elections. To conclude, we may highlight three\\naspects of liberalism which clearly help us in understanding its meanings: in social sphere,\\nliberalism stands for secularism and a society that opposes, all kinds of social discrimination;\\nin economic sphere, it favours a capitalistic economy , individual ownership of the means of\\nproduction and maximum profit-earning motive, in political sphere, it stands for a democratic\\npolity , individual rights and liberties, responsive and responsible government, free and\\nimpartial judiciary and the like.\\n4.1.2 Features of Liberalism\\nWe may identity certain characteristics of liberalism. These characteristic features are :\\n(1) Individual Liber ty : Liberalism is essentially an ideology of liberty . Its love for individual\\nliberty is unquestionable. It has become libertarianism. For the liberals, liberty is the very\\nessence of human personality . It is a means to one’ s development.\\n(2) Individual-centred theory :  Liberalism begins and ends with individual. For liberals,\\nindividual is the centre of all activities, the focal point; individual is the end while all other\\nassociations, including the state, are the means, which exist for the individual. individual is\\nthe centre around which all things move.\\n(3) Capitalistic Economy :  Liberalism advocates free-market economy , i.e., the capitalistic\\nmode of economy . It believes in private property system, regarding property rights as\\nsacrosanct; maximum profit as the only motive; capitalistic mode of production and'),\n",

The liberals view\\nthe state as a means for attaining the good of the individual. They oppose every type of\\ntotalitarian state. They are of the opinion that a more powerful state means a less free\\nindividual. Locke used to say , “because the functions of the state are limited, so are limited\\nits powers.”\\n(5) Opposed to Traditions/Superstitions :  As liberalism rose as a reaction against\\ntraditions/superstitions, it is, by its nature, opposed to all reactionary measures. Liberalism,\\nemerging from Renaissance and Reformation, stood, and actually stands, for reason and\\nrationalism. As against the feudal model of man as a passive being, liberalism favours a\\nmodel of man who is more active and more acquisitive.\\n(6) Democracy :  Liberalism is an exponent of democratic government. It seeks to establish\\na government of the people, by the people and for the people; a government that functions\\naccording to the Constitution and constitutionalism; a government that upholds the rule of\\nlaw; a government that secures rights and liberties of the people. Liberalism, McGovern\\nsays, is a combination of democracy and individualism.\\n(7) Welfar eism :  Liberalism is closely associated with welfarism. Welfarism, as a state\\nactivity , is the idea that state works for the welfare of the people. The liberal concept of\\nstate activity is one where the state serves the people. In other words, the welfare sate is\\na ‘social service’ state.\\n4.1.3  Weaknesses of Liberalism\\nLiberalism has its own inherent defects. It is a philosophy full of tensions. On the one\\nhand, it unfurls the flag of liberty , and on the other , it ar gues for equality . On the one hand,\\nit works, within the framework of market society , it promises equal opportunities to all. On\\nthe one hand, it asks for unlimited rights to acquire property , and on the other , it seeks to\\ndemand a share of profit for the welfare of those who are unemployed and the needy . On\\nthe one hand, it builds a capitalistic economy , ending up ultimately in inequalities, and on\\nthe other , it endeavours to establish an egalitarian society .\\nIntext Questions 4.1\\nFill in the blank\\n1.

The workers who\\nentered the factories were subject to all sorts of exploitation\\n: long hours of work, life in slums, ill-health etc. The result\\nwas exploitation of the workers, ever-increasing gap between\\nthe rich and the poor , economic inequalities, degradation and\\nalienation. Karl Marx and Frederich Engels realised clearly\\nthe adverse effects of capitalism and in the process, brought\\nout what is called scientific socialism or Marxism (after the\\nname of Marx). Those who contributed to the Marxian\\nphilosophy after Marx and Engels include, among others, V.I.\\nLenin (Russia), and Mao Zedong (China).\\nAlienation  means aloofness, estrangement, apathy , cutting of f. Mar x finds\\nalienation in extermination i.e., man finds himself external (alien) to his\\nactivity , his self.\\n4.2.1 Marxism and its Basic Postulates\\nMarxism is the political philosophy of the working class as liberalism is the political philosophy\\nof the capitalist class. It is a theory of social change : why social changes take place and\\nhow do these changes come into effect? The social changes take place because of the\\nmaterial factors and through a method called ‘dialectical materialistic’ method.\\nMarxism is based on certain assumptions/postulates. These are :\\n1) Nothing happens in the world on its own; there is always a cause -effect relationship\\nin what we see around. The relations of production (i.e., material relations among\\nthe people), as the basis of society , provide the cause while the productive forces\\nconstitute the effect.\\n2) The real development is always the material development (i.e., the economic\\ndevelopment). The progressive development of productive forces indicates the\\nprogressive level of development.\\n3) The material (i.e. economic) factor is the dominant factor in both individual life and\\nsocial life.\\n4) Human being is born at a particular stage of social / material development, i.e., born\\nin a social setting which exists independent of him. But being an active being, human\\nbeing makes his own social setting. Marx had said, human beings are born in history ,\\nbut they make history .\\n5) Social classes, especially the opposing classes, through their struggle and following\\nthe process of revolution, move in the forward direction. That is why the Marxists\\nsay that every subsequent society is better than the preceding society .\\n6) Revolutions mean total and wholesome changes; they are not a negative force, but\\nare what Marx had called, the locomotives of history . When launched and successful,\\nrevolutions take the society to a higher stage of development.\\nKarlMarx\\n(1818 – 1883)'),\n",

It is neither impartial\\nnor just; it is a class institution. It is a partisan, oppressive and exploitative institution;\\nit exists to serve the dominant class of which it is an instrument. In the capitalist\\nsociety , the capitalist state protects and promotes the interests of the capitalists while\\nin the socialist society , it protects and promotes the interests of the working class. By\\nthe time the socialist society becomes fully communistic, the state would, by then,\\nhave withered away .\\nWithering away  of the state, according to the Mar xists, means disappearing\\nof the state, i.e., slowly and gradually the state apparatus would go the whole\\nway.\\nThus, Marxism advocates communism as the highest form of society where men would\\nwork as they wish and would get what they want : “from each according to his ability to\\neach according to his needs.”\\n4.2.2 Highlights of Marxism\\nMarxism revolves around the following theoretical propositions.\\nDialectical materialism  is the sum-total of the general principles which explain as to\\nwhy and how social changes take place. The social changes take place because of the\\nmaterial factors and through the dialectical materialistic method. The dialectical materialistic\\nmethod is a triple method. According to Marx,\\nRelations of Productions  constitute the basis of the society at any given point of time.\\nWhat are called the social relations among the people are, for the Marxists, the relations of\\nproduction.\\nProductive Forces  constitute those elements which originate from the relations of\\nproduction, but which, though opposite to the latter , promise more production through newer\\nmethods/devices.\\nIn very simple words, the Marxian theory states that all development takes place through\\nstruggle between opposites and because of factors which are economic.\\nNew Mode of Production  is the result of the struggle between the relations of\\nproduction and productive forces at a matured stage of their development. The new\\nmode of production has the merits of both the relations of production and productive\\nforces; hence a higher stage of economic development.\\nHistorical Materialism  is also called the economic/materialistic/ deterministic\\ninterpretation of history . The Marxian explanation of history is that it is a record of the\\nself-development of productive forces; that the society keeps marching on its path of\\neconomic/ material development; that each stage of development indicates the level of\\ndevelopment attained; that history is the history of numerous socio- economic formations:\\nprimitive communistic, slave-owning, feudal, capitalist and thereafter the transitional socialist\\nfollowed by the communist society; that each succeeding society is an improvement over\\nthe preceeding one; that the socialist society , after the abolition of the capitalist society\\nwould be a classless society but with a state in the form of the dictatorship of the proletariat;\\nthe communist society , which follows the socialists society , would be both classless society\\nand stateless society .\\nTheor y of Surplus Value is another characteristic of Marxism. Marx says that it is the'),\n",

But he does not get\\nwhat he produces, he gets only the wages: over and above the wages is what goes to the\\nemployer . That is the surplus value. The surplus value is the dif ference between what the\\nvalue a labourer produces and what he gets in the form of wages. In simple words, the\\nlabourer gets the wages; the employer , the profit. This surplus value makes the rich, richer\\nand the poor , poorer . It is through surplus value that capitalists thrive.\\nTheor y of Class S truggle  is another tenet of Marxism. In the Marxian view , all hitherto\\nhistory has been the history of class struggle between opposing classes. Class struggle is\\nthe characteristic of class societies. In the classless societies, there is no class struggle\\nbecause there are, in such societies, no opposing/ antagonistic classes. Class struggle, in\\nclass societies, (i.e., in slave-owning society , the feudal society , the capitalist society) is of\\nmainly three types: economic, ideological, political.\\nMarxism advocates revolution . Revolutions, the Marxists say , are locomotives of history .\\nRevolutions occur when the relations of production come into conflict with the productive\\nforces, leading, thus, to a new mode of production. They bring about a complete\\ntransformation of society , without violence if possible, and with it, if necessary . Revolutions,\\nindicate changes: wholesome changes, changes in the very character of a given society .\\nThey signify the coming up of a higher stage of social development. Accordingly , the\\nMarxists regard revolution as a positive phenomenon.\\nDictatorship of the proletariat  means the rule of the working class. It is a state of the\\nworkers in the socialist society which follows the capitalist society . It is the dictatorship of\\nthe workers in the socialist society in the sense there is the dictatorship of the capitalists in\\nthe capitalist society . There capitalists rule the way they want; now the workers’  rule in\\nthe socialist society the way the workers want. Nevertheless, Marx makes it clear that the\\ndictatorship of the proletariat, i.e., the workers’ state, is an interim or a transitional\\narrangement which functions between the capitalist society and the communist society .\\nOnce the socialist society is completely established, the workers state will not be needed,\\ni.e., it will wither away (disappear slowly). Lenin insists that the dictatorship of the proletariat\\nis better than the bourgeois state, both quantitatively and qualitatively (at it looks after the\\ninterests and welfare of the whole multitude of the workers rather than handful of capitalists).\\nThe socialist society that follows the capitalist society after its abolition is a classless\\nsociety . It is a classless society in the sense that all are workers wheresoever they work,\\nin the of fice, in the factory or on the fields: each gets job according to one’ s ability (‘from\\neach according to his abilities to each according to his work’). The communist society\\nwhich follows the socialist society , will be both the classless society and the stateless\\nsociety .\\n4.2.3 Relevance of Marxism\\nMarxism, both as a philosophy and also as a practice, has attained a position unparallelled\\nin social and political thought. Its appeal crosses all boundaries, and in fact, all limits. Its\\nadversaries are as much convinced of its strength as are its admirers. And yet its\\nshortcomings are obvious.\\nChanges do not occur simply because of the clashes between the opposing classes. History\\nis indebted to class cooperation as well for its development. Material factor , though important\\nand dominating it may be, is not the sole factor in explaining the whole complex of society’ s\\nintricacies. Indeed, man does not live by bread alone, but it is also true that he can not live'),\n",

Gandhiji was a liberal among the Marxists, and a Marxist among the\\nliberals; he was a democrat among the individualists and an individualist among the socialists.\\nHe was an idealist among the realists, and a realist among the idealists. He had combined\\nin himself the virtues of all the known ideologies, past and present.\\n4.3.1 Gandhi as a Critic of Western Civilization\\nGandhiji was a critic of Western Civilization. His complaint against western materialism is\\nthat it destroys the very essence of spiritualism. He regarded the western type of man as\\nan atomistic individual, with all flesh and no soul.\\nAs against the state that existed in the West, Gandhiji advocated what he called, the\\nRamrajya; as against the western style of managing things through the centralizing forces,\\nhe stood for a decentralized polity . As against materialism, industrialization and capitalism,\\nhe made a strong plea for Swadeshi, cottage industries and the theory of Trusteeship.\\n4.3.2 S tate, Decentralization, Cottage Industries, Trusteeship\\nGandhiji is not an admirer of the type of the state that exists in the Western Society . For\\nhim, the Western state represented ‘violence in a concentrated form’; it is a soulless\\nmachine. Accordingly , Gandhiji, as a philosophical anarchist, admitted the state, but very\\nunwillingly , only when it is most needed.\\nAnarchist  is one who is opposed to every type of state; anarchism is a theory of\\nlawlessness: without state, without government, without law .\\nGandhism stands for a non-violent state based on (i) the consent of the people (ii) the near\\nunity in the society . Gandhiji advocated decentralization of power: both political and\\neconomic. The spirit of Gandhian democracy is the spirit of decentralization. Decentralization\\nmeans devolution of power at each level beginning from individual/ local unit and reaching\\nthe apex. The essence of decentralization, according to Gandhiji, is that all powers flow\\nfrom below and go up, in ascending order .\\nSo considered, political power , in the Gandhian scheme, is vested in the individuals: the\\ncentre of all activity , the repository of Swaraj; from individual, power is transferred to the\\nvillage; from village, the power goes to the higher unit, and ultimately , ends up with the\\ncentral/ national government which, practically performs only the coordinating functions.\\nThus what is or what can not be done by the individual is done by the village, what is not\\ndone by the village is done by the local/ regional government; what is not done by the\\nregional/ provincial government is done by the central/ national government. The spirit of\\nthe Gandhian Ramrajya is that it is a self-regulating system where everyone is one’ s own\\nruler, and not a hindrance to one’ s neighbours.\\nGandhiji’ s concept of decentralization has an economic aspect. He ar gued for the devolution\\nof economic power as well. He advocated village economy through the promotion of\\nvillage, small, cottage industries. In fact, he was for the self-reliant village economy . His\\nconcept of Swadeshi is “that spirit which requires us to serve our immediate neighbours\\nand use things produced in our neibourhood in preference to those more remote.”\\nGandhiji favoured the revival of indigenous industries so that people could have enough to\\neat. In his opinion, any kind of economy which exploited people and helped concentrated\\nwealth in fewer hands, stands condemned.'),\n",

It was unique because it aimed at establishing\\ncordial relations between the capital and the labour . Declaring all property to be the property\\nof the community as a whole, Gandhiji pleaded that all the employers (industrialists, capitalists\\nand the like) are the trustees of what they hold. As such, they all are entitled only for the\\nmoney they need to satisfy their necessities as do the employees (the workers etc.). For\\nGandhiji no individual is the owner: all work and all are the workers; everyone gets for the\\nservice one renders; the profit is not of the owner , but is what belongs to the community .\\nThe employers are the trustees, and not the masters; the employees as necessary\\ncomponents of the enterprises, are the workers and not the slaves.\\n4.3.3 Ends and Means\\nAccording to Gandhiji, ends and means constitute two aspects of the same reality , i.e., two\\nsides of the same coin. They form an organic whole. Ends grow out of the means “As are\\nthe means, so are the ends”. Gandhiji used to say . He also said, the means may be likened\\nto a seed; the ends, to a tree and there is just the same inviolable connection between the\\nmeans and the ends as there is between the seed and the tree.” He argued that the state\\ncan not attain its ideal character as long as the means are tainted with violence. That is\\nwhy he always laid emphasis on the purity of means to achieve the ends. Impure means\\ncan not achieve pure ends. He said once: “I would not accept Swaraj if it comes through\\nbloodshed”. Again, “For me, Ahimsa comes before Swaraj.” So close and inseparable is\\nthe relation between the two that if one takes care of the means, the ends will take care of\\nthemselves. Furthermore, the realization of the goal has to be, for Gandhiji, in proportion to\\nthat of the means.\\nGandhiji was no Machiavelli. For Machiavelli, ends justify the means; for Gandhiji, means\\njustify the ends.\\n4.3.4 Society and Sarvodaya\\nGandhism is not only a theory of politics, economy , religion, strategy , but also is a theory of\\nsociety . Gandhiji’ s whole social philosophy is a philosophy of equality: equality not in the\\nsense of absolute equality , but in the sense that as human beings, all are equal. A society\\nbased on equality , according to Gandhiji, is a society which rejects any and every type of\\ndiscrimination: either on the basis of caste, creed, class, sex, race, or region. We are born\\nas human beings, not as Hindus or Muslims, We are born as human beings, not as an upper\\ncaste being or a dalit. Gandhiji is opposed to all types of discriminatory tendencies and\\ntrends. For him, there is only one caste, one class, one religion, one race, and that is\\nhumanity . He, therefore, did not admit any discrimination. In fact, he was more for the\\nwelfare of the weaker , i.e., for women as compared to men; for the weaker sections of\\nsociety: the Harijans, the Dalits. It is not that he wanted to deprive ‘A ’ and ‘give’  to ‘B’; it\\nis that he wanted to give ‘B’  more so as to enable him to get to the heights of ‘A ’. He\\nadvocated equality so as to level people in social, economic, and political hierarchy . His\\nconcept of equality aimed at bridging the gaps and not distancing them.\\nGandhiji’ s concept of Sarvodaya sums up his views on the kind of society he used to\\ndream. Sarvodaya, as Gandhiji had visualised, is the greatest good of all the members of\\nthe society . It is the welfare of all. It is the good of the individual together with the good of\\nall the individuals, i.e., the good of each with the good of all. The concept of good in\\nSarvodaya is not merely material, it is moral and spiritual as well.'),\n",

It is therefore,\\nsuggested that it should have a government of a particular form with appropriate powers\\nand functions.\\nThe document containing laws and rules which determine and describe the form of the\\ngovernment, the relationship between the citizens and the government, is called a\\nConstitution.\\nAs such a constitution is concerned with two main aspects the relation between the different\\nlevels of government and between the government and the citizens.\\nA constitution is the basic fundamental law of a State. It lays down the objectives of the\\nState which it has to achieve. It also provides for the constitutional framework that is,\\nvarious structures and organs of the governments at different levels.

The Assembly was\\nconstituted in 1946.\\nThe members of the Constituent Assembly were indirectly elected by the members of the\\nexisting Provincial Assemblies. In addition, there were members nominated by the rulers\\nof the Princely S tates. With Independence of India, the Constituent Assembly became a\\nfully sovereign body .\\nThe Constituent Assembly , following the partition of the country in 1947, consisted of 299\\nmembers as on 31st December 1947. Of these 229 members were elected by the provincial\\nassemblies and the rest were nominated by the rulers of the princely states. Majority of\\nthe members in the Constituent Assembly belonged to the Congress party . All prominent\\nleaders of the freedom movement were members of the Assembly .\\nPrincely S tates During the British Rule there were about 560 areas which were not\\ndirectly under the control of the British.

Therefore, the framers of the Constitution\\nwere concerned about the aspirations of the people, integrity and unity of the country and\\nestablishment of a democratic society . Amongst the members there were some who held\\ndifferent ideological views. There were others who were inclined to socialist principles,\\nstill others holding Gandhian thinking but nothing could act as any kind of impediment in the\\nprogress of the Assembly’ s work because all these members were of liberal ideas. Their\\nmain aim was to give India a ‘Constitution’ which will fulfill the cherished ideas and ideals\\nof the people of this country .\\nDr. Rajendra Prasad signing the new constitution\\nConscious efforts were made to have consensus on different issues and principles and\\nthereby avoid disagreement. The consensus came in the form of the ‘Objectives Resolution’\\nmoved by Jawahar Lal Nehru in the Constituent Assembly on December 17, 1946 which\\nwas almost unanimously adopted on January 22, 1947. In the light of these ‘Objectives’\\nthe Assembly completed its task by November 26, 1949. The constitution was enforced\\nwith effect from January 26, 1950. From that day India became a Republic. Exactly\\ntwenty years before the first independence day was celebrated on Jan. 26, 1930 as decided\\nby the Lahore session of the Congress on Dec. 31, 1929. Hence, January 26, 1950 was\\ndecided as the day to enforce the constitution.\\n5.4 The Preamble\\nAs you know that the Constitution of India commences with a Preamble. Let us find out\\n'),\n",

The Preamble is like an introduction or preface of a book. As an\\nintroduction, it is not a part of the contents but it explains the purposes and objectives with\\nwhich the document has been written. So is the case with the ‘Preamble’ to the Indian\\nConstitution. As such the ‘Preamble’  provides the guide lines of the Constitution.\\nPreamble of Indian Constitution\\nThe Preamble, in brief, explains the objectives of the Constitution in two ways: one, about\\nthe structure of the governance and the other , about the ideals to be achieved in independent\\nIndia. It is because of this, the Preamble is considered to be the key of the Constitution.\\nThe objectives, which are laid down in the Preamble, are:\\ni) Description of Indian S tate as Sovereign, Socialist, Secular , Democratic Republic.\\n(Socialist, Secular added by 42nd Amendment, 1976).\\nii) Provision to all the citizens of India i.e.,\\na) Justice  social, economic and political\\nb) Liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship\\nc) Equality of status and opportunityTHE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA\\nPREAMBLE\\nWE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA , having solemnly resolved to\\nconstitute India into a 1[SOVEREIGN SOCIALIST SECULAR\\nDEMOCRA TIC REPUBLIC] and to secure to all its citizens:\\nJUSTICE, social, economic and political;\\nLIBER TY of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship;\\nEQUALITY  of status and of opportunity;\\nand to promote among them all\\nFRA TERNITY  assuring the dignity of the individual and the\\n2[unity and integrity of the Nation];\\nIN OUR CONSTITUENT  ASSEMBL Y this twenty-sixth day of\\nNovember , 1949, do HEREBY  ADOPT , ENACT  AND GIVE TO\\nOURSEL VES THIS CONSTITUTION.\\n1.

It means absolute\\nindependence, i.e., a government which is not controlled by any other power : internal or\\nexternal. A country cannot have its own constitution without being sovereign. India is a\\nsovereign country . It is free from external control. It can frame its policies. India is free to\\nformulate its own foreign policy .\\nSocialist\\nThe word socialist was not there in the Preamble of the Constitution in its original form. In\\n1976, the 42nd Amendment to the Constitution incorporated ‘Socialist’  and ‘Secular ’, in the\\nPreamble. The word ‘Socialism’ had been used in the context of economic planning. It\\nsignifies major role in the economy . It also means commitment to attain ideals like removal\\nof inequalities, provision of minimum basic necessities to all, equal pay for equal work.\\nWhen you read about the Directive Principles of the S tate Policy , you will see how these\\nideals have been incorporated as well as partly , implemented in the Constitution.\\nSecularism\\nIn the context of secularism in India, it is said that ‘India is neither religious, nor irreligious\\nnor anti-religious.’ Now what does this imply? It implies that in India there will be no\\n‘State’ religion – the ‘State’ will not support any particular religion out of public fund. This\\nhas two implications, a) every individual is free to believe in, and practice, any religion he/\\nshe belongs to, and, b) State will not discriminate against any individual or group on the\\nbasis of religion.\\nDemocratic Republic\\nAs you have noticed while reading the Preamble to the Constitution, that the Constitution\\nbelongs to the people of India. The last line of the Preamble says ‘…. Hereby Adopt,\\nEnact And Give To Ourselves This Constitution’. In fact the Democratic principles of the\\ncountry flow from this memorable last line of the Preamble. Democracy is generally\\nknown as government of the people, by the people and for the people. Effectively this\\nmeans that the Government is elected by the people, it is responsible and accountable to\\nthe people. The democratic principles are highlighted with the provisions of universal adult\\nfranchise, elections, fundamental rights, and responsible government. These you will read\\nin subsequent lessons.\\nThe Preamble also declares India as a Republic. It means that the head of the State is the\\nPresident who is indirectly elected and he is not a hereditary ruler as in case of the British\\nMonarch. Under chapter of Union Executive you will read in detail about the election of\\nthe President of  India.'),\n",

India became a Republic on _____________ (15 August, 1947, 26 November 1949/\\n26 January 1950).\\n5.6  Justice, Liberty and Equality\\nThe struggle for freedom was not only against the British rule but their struggle should also\\nusher in an era of restoring the dignity of men and women, removal of poverty and end to\\nall types of exploitation. Such strong motivations and cherished ideals had prompted the\\nframers to lay emphasis on the provisions of Justice, Liberty and Equality to all the citizens\\nof India.\\nJustice\\nJustice promises to give people what they are entitled to in terms of basic rights to food,\\nclothing, housing, participation in the decision-making and living with dignity as human\\nbeings. The Preamble covers all these dimensions of justice – social, economic and political.\\nBesides, the granting of political justice in the form of universal adult franchise or the\\nrepresentative form of democracy . You will read socio-economic justice in next lessons.\\nLiberty\\nThe Preamble also mentions about liberty of thought and expression. These freedoms\\nhave been guaranteed in the Constitution through the Fundamental Rights. Though freedom\\nfrom want has not been guaranteed in the Fundamental Rights, certain directives to the\\nState have been mentioned in the Directive Principles.\\nEquality\\nEquality is considered to be the essence of modern democratic ideology . The Constitution\\nmakers placed the ideals of equality in a place of pride in the Preamble. All kinds of\\ninequality based on the concept of rulers and the ruled or on the basis of caste and gender ,\\nwere to be eliminated. All citizens of India should be treated equally and extended equal\\nprotection of law without any discrimination based on caste, creed, birth, religion, sex etc.\\nSimilarly equality of opportunities implies that regardless of the socio-economic situations\\ninto which one is born, he/she will have the same chance as everybody else to develop his/\\nher talents and choose means of livelihood.\\nIntext Questions 5.3\\nFill in the blanks :\\n1.

There\\nwas a need for harmonious co-existence among various religions, linguistic, cultural and\\neconomic groups. Inclusion of phrases like ‘dignity of individuals’, ‘fraternity among people’\\nand ‘unity and integrity of the nation’ in the Preamble highlight such a need.\\nEgalitarian: A society , which feels concerned for meeting the needs of all its\\nmembers, is known as egalitarian society . An egalitarian state is expected to reduce\\ninequalities among citizens and fulfill minimum requirements of all.\\nThe Preamble has provided for a vision humane which is, democratic, secular and,\\ntherefore, egalitarian. Therefore, inspite of not being a part of the Constitution, the\\nPreamble has always been given due respect and regard by the courts while\\ninterpreting the Constitution.\\n5.8 Salient Features of The Constitution\\nSo far you have read about the Preamble to the Indian Constitution. In the subsequent\\nparagraphs you are going to read about the salient features of the Indian Constitution\\nwhich directly and indirectly flow from the Preamble, indicating the faith of framers in the\\nideals, objectives and goals as mentioned in our Constitution.\\nA Written Constitution\\nThe Indian Constitution is mainly a written constitution. A written constitution is framed at\\na given time and comes into force or is adopted on a fixed date as a document. As you\\nhave already read that our constitution was framed over a period of 2 years, 1 1 months\\nand 18 days, it was adopted on 26th November , 1949 and enforced on January 26, 1950.\\nCertain conventions have gradually evolved over a period of time which have proved\\nuseful in the working of the constitution. The British Constitution is an example of unwritten\\nconstitution. It is to be noted though, that a written constitution is ‘mainly’ an enacted\\ndocument, there could be bodies or institutions which may not be included in the constitution\\nbut form an important part of governance. In Indian context one can mention the Planning\\nCommission. It is very important body for country’ s planning and development. But, the\\nplanning commission was set up in March 1950, not by an Act of Parliament, nor as a Part\\nof the Constitution of India. It was set up by a cabinet resolution. The Indian constitution\\nis the lengthiest in the world. The original constitution had 395 Articles and 8 Schedules,\\nwhile, the constitution of USA  has only 7 Articles.\\nIntext Question 5.4\\nFill in the blanks :\\na) A Constitution is a body of ______________ (rules, basic laws, principles).\\nb) The Constitution of India was enforced on _________________ (August 15, 1947,\\nNovember 26, 1949, January 26, 1950)'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Hp\\\\Documents\\\\vscode\\\\prepbridge\\\\prepbridge\\\\data\\\\indian-polity.pdf', 'page': 53}, page_content='MODULE - 2\\nNotes\\n52Political Science\\nAspects of the\\nConstitution of Indiac) The original Indian Constitution consisted of _______________ Articles. (495, 395,\\n295)\\nd) The constitution of India was adopted by ______________. (Constitution Assembly ,\\nCommittee, State assembly)\\nA Combination of Rigidity and Flexibility\\nThe Indian Constitution is a unique example of combination of rigidity and flexibility . A\\nconstitution may be called rigid or flexible on the basis of its amending procedure. In a rigid\\nconstitution, amendment of the constitution is not easy . The Constitutions of USA,\\nSwitzerland and Australia are considered rigid constitutions. While, the British Constitution\\nis considered flexible because amendment procedure is easy and simple.\\nThe Constitution of India provides for three categories of amendments. In the first category ,\\namendment can be done by the two houses of Parliament simple majority of the members\\npresent and voting of before sending it for the President’ s assent. In the second category\\namendments require a special majority . Such an amendment can be passed by each House\\nof Parliament by a majority of the total members of that House as well as by the 2/3rd\\nmajority of the members present and voting in each house of Parliament and send to the\\nPresident for his assent which cannot be denied. In the third category besides the special\\nmajority mentioned in the second category , the same has to be approved also by at least\\n50% of the State legislatures. Thus, you see that the Indian Constitution provides for the\\ntype of amendments ranging from simple to most difficult procedure depending on the\\nnature of the amendment.\\nFederal Polity\\nIndia has adopted a federal structure. In a federation there are two distinct levels of\\ngovernments. There is one government for the whole country which is called the Union or\\nCentral Government. Also there is government for each Unit/S tate. The United S tates of\\nAmerica is a federation whereas the United Kingdom (Britain) has a unitary form of\\ngovernment. In a unitary structure there is only one government for the whole country and\\nthe power is centralised.\\nThe Constitution of India does not use the term ‘federal state’. It says that India is a\\n‘Union of States’. There is a distribution of powers between the Union/Central Government\\nand the State Governments. Since India is a federation, such distribution of functions\\nbecomes necessary . There are three lists of powers such as Union List, S tate List and the\\nConcurrent List. These lists have been explained in Lesson 8 in detail. On the basic of this\\ndistribution, India may be called a federal system.\\nThe supremacy of the judiciary is an essential feature of a federation so that the constitution\\ncould be interpreted impartially . In India, the Supreme Court has been established to guard\\nthe constitution. However , in case of Indian federalism, more powers have been given to\\nthe Union Government in administrative, legislative, financial and judicial matters. In fact,\\nThe Indian federal set up stands out with certain distinctive unitary features. The makers\\nof our constitution while providing for two sets of government at the centre and in the\\nstates provided for division of powers favouring the Central Government, appointment of\\nthe Head of the S tate government by the Central Government, single unified judiciary ,\\nsingle citizenship indicate the unitary nature of our federalism. Therefore, it is said that\\nIndia has a quasi-federal set up.'),\n",

This has been adopted from the British\\nsystem. In a parliamentary democracy there is a close relationship between the legislature\\nand the executive. The Cabinet is selected from among the members of legislature. The\\ncabinet is responsible to the latter . In fact the Cabinet holds of fice so long as it enjoys the\\nconfidence of the legislature. In this form of democracy , the Head of the S tate is nominal.\\nIn India, the President is the Head of the State. Constitutionally the President enjoys\\nnumerous powers but in practice the Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister ,\\nwhich really exercises these powers. The President acts on the advice of the Prime Minister\\nand the Council of Ministers.\\nFundamental Rights and Fundamental Duties\\nEvery human being is entitled to enjoy certain rights which ensure good living. In a\\ndemocracy all citizens enjoy equal rights. The Constitution of India guarantees those rights\\nin the form of Fundamental Rights.\\nFundamental Rights are one of the important features of the Indian Constitution. The\\nConstitution provides for six Fundamental Rights about which you will read in the following\\nlesson. Fundamental Rights are justiciable and are protected by the judiciary . In case of\\nviolation of any of these rights one can move to the court of law for their protection.\\nFundamental Duties were added to our Constitution by the 42nd Amendment. It lays down\\na list of ten Fundamental Duties for all citizens of India. While the rights are given as\\nguarantees to the people, the duties are obligations which every citizen is expected to\\nperform.\\nIntext Questions 5.5\\nFill in the blanks :\\n(a) India is a _________________ S tate. (unitary , federal, quasi-federal)\\n(b) In a parliamentary democracy , the ___________ enjoys the real power (people,\\npresident, cabinet).\\n(c) The fundamental rights are ________________ (absolute, justiciable, unlimited).\\n(d) The fundamental duties were included by the ________________ amendment (42nd,\\n44th, 46th).\\nDirective Principles of S tate Policy\\nThe Directive Principles of State Policy which have been adopted from the Irish Constitution,\\nis another unique feature of the Constitution of India. The Directive Principles were included\\nin our Constitution in order to provide social and economic justice to our people. Directive\\nPrinciples aim at establishing a welfare state in India where there will be no concentration\\nof wealth in the hands of a few . You will read about these Principles more elaborately in\\nLesson 7.'),\n",

The Supreme Court stands as the apex court\\nof the judicial system. Below the Supreme Court are the High Courts. The High Courts\\ncontrol and supervise the lower courts. The Indian judiciary , thus, stands like a pyramid\\nwith the lower courts as the base, High Courts in the middle and the Supreme Court at the\\ntop.\\nIndependence of Judiciary\\nIndian judiciary is independent an impartial. The Indian judiciary is free from the influence\\nof the executive and the legislature. The judges are appointed on the basis of their\\nqualifications and cannot be removed easily . You will read about the independence of the\\njudiciary in detail in Lesson 12.\\nSingle Citizenship\\nIn a federal state usually the citizens enjoys double citizenship as is the case in the USA.\\nIn India there is only single citizenship. It means that every Indian is a citizen of India,\\nirrespective of the place of his/her residence or place of birth. He/she is not a citizen of the\\nConstituent State like Jharkhand, Uttaranchal or Chattisgarh to which he/she may belong\\nto but remains a citizen of India. All the citizens of India can secure employment anywhere\\nin the country and enjoy all the rights equally in all the parts of India.\\nUniversal Adult Franchise\\nIndian democracy functions on the basis of ‘one person one vote’. Every citizen of India\\nwho is 18 years of age or above is entitled to vote in the elections irrespective of caste,\\nsex, race, religion or status. The Indian Constitution establishes political equality in India\\nthrough the method of universal adult franchise.\\nEmergency Provisions\\nThe Constitution makers also foresaw that there could be situations when the government\\ncould not be run as in ordinary times. To cope with such situations, the Constitution elaborates\\non emergency provisions. There are three types of emergency; a) emergency caused by\\nwar, external aggression or armed rebellion; b) emer gency arising out of the failure of\\nconstitutional machinery in states; and c) financial emer gency . About emer gency provisions\\nyou will read in detail in Lesson 9.\\nIntext Questions 5.6\\nFill in the blanks :\\na) The United S tates of America has a system of ______________ citizenship.

These\\nrights ensure the fullest physical, mental and moral development of every citizen. They\\ninclude those basic freedoms and  conditions which alone can make life worth living.\\nFundamental Rights generate a feeling of security amongst the minorities in the country .\\nThey establish the framework of ‘democratic legitimacy’  for the rule of the majority . No\\ndemocracy can function in the absence of basic rights such as freedom of speech and\\nexpression.\\nFundamental Rights provide standards of conduct, citizenship, justice and fair play . They\\nserve as a check on the government. Various social, religious, economic and political\\nproblems in our country make Fundamental Rights important. In our Constitution,\\nFundamental Rights are enumerated in Part III from Article 14 to 32. These rights are\\njusticiable.\\nJusticiable:  Justiciable means that if these rights are violated by the government or\\nanyone else, the individual has the right to approach the Supreme Court or High\\nCourts for the protection of his/her Fundamental Rights.\\nOur Constitution does not permit the legislature and the executive to curb these rights\\neither by law or by an executive order . The Supreme Court or the High Courts can set\\naside any law that is found to be infringing or abridging the Fundamental Rights. You will\\nread about it in detail in the lesson on ‘Judiciary’. Some of the Fundamental Rights are also\\nenjoyed by foreigners, for example, the Right to Equality before Law and Right to Freedom\\nof Religion are enjoyed by both i.e. citizens as well as foreigners. The Fundamental Rights\\nthough justiciable are not absolute. The Constitution empowers the government to impose\\ncertain restrictions on the enjoyment of our rights in the interest of public good.\\nSeven Fundamental Rights were enshrined in the Constitution of India. However the Right\\nto Property was removed from the list of Fundamental Rights by the 44th Amendment Act\\nof the Constitution in the year 1976. Since then, it has been made a legal right. There are\\nnow six Fundamental Rights.\\nThe Fundamental Rights are: -\\n1.Right to Equality\\n2.Right to Freedom\\n3.Right against Exploitation\\n4.Right to Freedom of Religion\\n5.Cultural and Educational Rights, and\\n6.Right to Constitutional Remedies.\\nRecently by the 86th Amendment Act, the Right to Education has been included in the list\\nof Fundamental Rights as part of the Right to Freedom by adding Article 21(A).\\nWe will now study these rights one by one.'),\n",

In this lesson we will study about Directive\\nPrinciples in detail.\\nIt is a well-established saying that rights have significance only when enjoyed in consonance\\nwith the duties. Therefore, the Fundamental Duties were inserted in Article 51A  of our\\nConstitution in 1976 by 42nd Amendment Act. In the original Constitution in 1950, there\\nwas no mention of these duties.

Though these principles are non-justiciable,\\nthey are fundamental in the governance of the country . The idea of Directive Principles of\\nState Policy has been taken from the Irish Republic. They were incorporated in our\\nConstitution in order to provide economic justice and to avoid concentration of wealth in\\nthe hands of a few people. Therefore, no government can afford to ignore them. They are\\ninfact, the directives to the future governments to incorporate them in the decisions and\\npolicies to be formulated by them.\\n7.2 Classification Of The Directive Principles\\nDirective Principles of State Policy have been grouped into four categories.

Our\\ngovernment realized the importance of education and laid stress on the spread of literacy\\namong the masses. Efforts have been made by the governments to raise this level. But a\\nlarge section of our population is still illiterate. The foremost effort which is required in this\\nfield-is the spread of elementary education and its universalisation. Due to increased number\\nof drop outs at the primary stage, the number of illiterates between 15 to 35 years of age\\nhas constantly increased.\\nAccording to National Policy on Education, 1986, the government has launched National\\nLiteracy Mission, and ‘Operation Blackboard’ for the spread of mass literacy at primary\\nstage. For those who were deprived of the benefits of education in their childhood, the\\ngovernment and many voluntary agencies are making special efforts to educate them by\\nopening night schools and adult literacy centers.\\nMany distance education programmes through correspondence courses, distance education\\nand open learning have been started in different states. The National Institute of Open\\nSchooling and several Open Universities have been set up to attain the goal of universalisation\\nof education. The Directive Principles providing free and compulsory education for children\\nupto the age of 14 years has been included through the 86th Amendment Act, 2002 in the\\nlist of Fundamental Rights under Article 21A.\\nThough much has been achieved but still there is a long way to go to accomplish this\\nobjective of a welfare state.\\n7.3.2 Child Labour\\nYou have already read that one of the Directive Principles provides opportunities and\\nfacilities to children to develop in a healthy manner . You have also read about the Fundamental\\nRight against Exploitation of children. Employment of children below the age of 14 years\\nin mines and industries which are hazardous to their health is prohibited.\\nInspite of these provisions, the desired results have not been reached.

Necessity of raising the status and education of women\\nhas already been stressed in our Constitution through Fundamental Rights and various\\nDirective Principles of S tate Policy . They have been provided with the right to an adequate\\nmeans of livelihood and equal pay with that of men for their work. Women workers have\\nalso been provided for health-care and maternity-relief.\\nEven in the Fundamental Duties stress has been laid on the duty of every citizen of India\\nto renounce practices derogatory to the dignity of women.\\nMany laws and judicial decisions have restored the dignity of women.

Government is not bound to implement them. Critics\\npoint out that they are not formulated keeping the practical aspect these ideals in mind.\\nDespite all this, it can not be said that these Principles are absolutely useless. They have\\ntheir own utility and significance. The Directive Principles are just like a polestar that\\nprovide direction. Their basic aim is to persuade the government to provide social and\\neconomic justice in all spheres of life, keeping in view its limited material resources, at the\\nearliest possible. Many of them have been implemented very successfully . Actually , no\\ngovernment can afford to ignore these instructions as they are the mirror of the public\\nopinion and also reflect the basic spirit of the Preamble of our Constitution.

(72nd, 73rd, 71st)\\n7.5 Distinction between Fundamental Rights and Directive\\nPrinciples\\nNow that you know about Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of S tate Policy ,\\nwhich are playing an important role in the establishment of the political and socio-economic\\nsociety in India, it is important for you to learn about the distinction between the two. The\\nFundamental Rights are claims of the citizens recognized by the state. They are in the\\nnature of denial of certain authority to the government. They are, therefore, negative in\\nnature. The Directive Principles are like positive directions that the government at all\\nlevels must follow to contribute to the establishment social and economic democracy in\\nIndia.\\nAnother point of difference as mentioned earlier is that while the Fundamental Rights are\\njusticiable and are enforceable by the court of law , the Directive Principles are non-\\njusticiable. In other words, the Supreme Court and the High Courts have the powers to\\nissue orders or writs for enforcement of Fundamental Rights. The Directive Principles of\\nState Policy , on the other hand, confer no legal rights and create no legal remedies. This\\nshould not lead us to conclude that the Directive Principles are inferior or subordinate to\\nthe Fundamental Rights.\\n7.5.1 Relationship between Fundamental Rights and\\nDirective Principles\\nInspite of these differences, there is a close relationship between the two. Fundamental\\nRights and Directive Principles are complementary and supplementary to each other .\\nWhereas the Fundamental Rights establish political democracy , the Directive Principles\\nestablish economic and social democracy . No government can af ford to ignore them while\\nformulating its plans and policies as it is responsible for all its actions to the people in\\ngeneral. Although there is no legal sanction behind these principles, the ultimate sanction\\nlies with the people. The people with their opinion will never let the ruling party to acquire\\npower again if it fails to adhere to these guiding principles. Thus, our Constitution aims at\\nbringing about a synthesis between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of state\\npolicy . Together , they form the core of the Constitution.\\nIntext Questions 7.4\\nFill in the blanks:-\\n(a) The Directive Principles are _________ in nature.

Let us examine them and try to find out\\nwhether India is a federation or not.\\n8.1.1 Written Constitution\\nThe most important feature of a federation is that its constitution should be a written one,\\nso that both the Union Government as well as the State can refer to that as and when\\nneeded. The Constitution of India is a written document and is the most elaborate\\nConstitution of the world. It establishes supremacy of the Constitution because both the\\nunion and the states are given powers by the Constitution as to be independent in their\\nspheres of governance.\\n8.1.2 Rigid Constitution\\nThe procedure of amending the Constitution in a federal system is normally rigid. Indian\\nConstitution provides that some amendments require a special majority . Such an amendment\\nhas to be passed by majority of total members of each house of the Parliament as well as\\nby two-thirds majority of the members present and voting there in. However , in addition to\\nthis process, some amendments must be approved by at least 50% of the states. After this\\nprocedure the amendment is signed by the head of the state i.e; the President. Since in\\nIndia important amendments can be amended through this procedure. Hence, Indian\\nConstitution has been rightly called a rigid constitution.\\n8.1.3  Division of Powers\\nIn our Constitution, there is a clear division of powers, so that the States and the Centre\\nare required to enact and legislate within their sphere of activity and none violates its limits\\nand tries to encroach upon the functions of the other . Our constitution enumerates three\\nlists, viz. the Union, the State and the Concurrent List. The Union List consists of 97\\nsubjects of national importance such as Defence, Railways, Post and Telegraph, etc. The\\nState List consists of 66 subjects of local interest such as Public Health, Police etc. The\\nConcurrent List has 47 subjects important to both the Union and the S tate. such as Electricity ,\\nTrade Union, Economic and Social Planning, etc.\\n8.1.4 Supremacy of the Judiciary\\nAnother very important feature of a federation is an independent judiciary to interpret the\\nConstitution and to maintain its sanctity . The Supreme Court of India has the original\\njurisdiction to settle disputes between the Union and the States. It can declare a law as\\nunconstitutional, if it contravenes any provision of the Constitution.\\nIntext Questions 8.1\\nFill in the blanks :\\n1. In a federation the powers are ———————————.

(97,47,66)\\n8.2 Nature of Indian Federation\\nIn spite of the fact that the Indian Constitution establishes a federal structure, it is indeed\\nvery difficult to put the Indian Constitution in the category of a true federation. The framers\\nof the Constitution have modified the true nature of Indian federation by incorporating\\ncertain non-federal features in it. These are :\\nArticle I of the Constitution describes India as a ‘Union of States’, which implies two\\nthings: firstly , it is not the result of an agreement among the S tates and secondly , the S tates\\nhave no freedom to secede or separate from the Union. Besides, the Constitution of the\\nUnion and the States is a single framework from which neither can get out and within\\nwhich they must function. The federation is a union because it is indestructible and helps\\nto maintain the unity of the country .\\nThe Centre appoints the Governors of the States and may take over the administration of\\nthe State on the recommendations of the Governor or otherwise. In other words, Governor\\nis the agent of the Centre in the States. The working of Indian federal system clearly\\nreveals that the Governor has acted more as centre’ s representative than as the head of\\nthe State. This enables the Union government to exercise control over the State\\nadministration. The control of the Union over states after the imposition of National\\nEmer gency .\\nThe equality of units in a federation is best guaranteed by their equal representation in the\\nUppers House of the federal legislature (Parliament). However , this is not applicable in\\ncase of Indian States. They have unequal representation in the Rajya Sabha. In a true\\nfederation such as that of United S tate of America every S tate irrespective of their size in\\nterms of area or population it sends two representatives in the upper House i.e. Senate.\\nIn addition to all this, all important appointments such as the Chief Election Commissioner ,\\nthe Comptroller and Auditor General are made by the Union Government. Besides, there\\nis single citizenship. There is no provision for separate Constitutions for the states. The\\nStates cannot propose amendments to, the Constitution. As such amendments can only be\\nmade by the Union Parliament.\\nIn order to ensure uniformity of the administrative system and to maintain minimum common\\nadministrative standards without impairing the federal system. All India Services such as\\nIAS and IPS have been created which are kept under the control of the Union. In financial\\nmatters too, the States depend upon the Union to a great extent. The States do not possess\\nadequate financial resources to meet their requirements. During Financial Emer gency , the\\nCenter exercises full control over the S tate’s finances.\\nIn case of disturbances in any State or part thereof, the Union Government is empowered\\nto depute Central Force in the S tate or to the disturbed part of the S tate. Also, the Parliament,\\nby law may increase or decrease the area of any State and may alter its name and\\nboundaries.'),\n",

The State Governments have very limited powers.\\nFinancially the States are dependent on the Centre\\nFrom the above discussion, it is clear , that there is a tilt in favor of the Centre at the cost of\\nthe States. The States have to work in close co-operation with the Centre.

(unequal/equal/proportional)\\n8.3 Centr e-State Relations\\nWe have seen that the Constitution of India provides for a federal system. Both the Union\\nand the State are created by the Constitution and derive their respective authority from it.\\nYet there is a criticism that India is a federal S tate but with unitary features. How far is\\nthis criticism valid? To understand this, it is desirable to study the relationship between the\\nUnion and the States.\\nThe relations between the Centre and the states which constitute the core of federalism\\nhave been enumerated in Parts XI and XII of the Constitution under the heads, legislative,\\nadministrative and financial relations. Let us examine them one by one.\\n8.3.1 Legislative Relations\\nRegarding legislative relations, there is a threefold division of powers in the Constitution.\\nWe have followed a system in which there are two lists of legislative powers, one for the\\nCentre and the other for the S tate, known as the Union List and the S tate List, respectively .\\nAn additional list called the Concurrent List has also been added.\\nThe Union List which consists of 97 subjects of national interest is the largest of the three\\nlists. Some of the important subjects included in this list are: Defence, Railways, Post and\\nTelegraph, Income Tax, Custom Duties, etc. The Parliament has the exclusive power to\\nenact laws on the subjects included in the Union List for the entire country .\\nThe State List consists of 66 subjects of local interest. Some of the important subjects\\nincluded in this List are Trade and Commerce within the S tate, Police, Fisheries, Forests,\\nIndustries, etc. The State Legislatures have been empowered to make laws on the subjects\\nincluded in the State List.'),\n",

Some of the subjects included in this list are: Stamp Duties, Drugs and Poison,\\nElectricity , Newspapers etc. Both the Parliament and the S tate Legislatures can make\\nlaws on the subjects included in this list. But in case of a conflict between the Union and\\nthe S tate law relating to the same subject, the Union law prevails over the S tate law .\\nPower to legislate on all subjects not included in any of the three lists vests with the\\nParliament.\\nUnder certain circumstances, the Parliament can legislate on the subjects mentioned in\\nthe State List.\\n8.3.2 Administrative Relations\\nThe framers of the Indian Constitution never intended to create administrative co-operation\\nand co-ordination between the centre and states.\\nThe executive power of the State is to be exercised in such a way as to ensure compliance\\nwith the laws made by the Parliament. Further , the Union Executive is empowered to give\\ndirections to a S tate, if necessary , for the requisite purpose.\\nThe Union Government can issue directions to the States to ensure compliance with the\\nlaws of the Parliament for construction and maintenance of means of communications,\\ndeclared to be of national and military importance, and also on the measures for the protection\\nof Railways. In addition to all this, the Parliament can alone adjudicate on inter-state river\\ndisputes. Also, a provision has been made for constituting an Inter - State Council to advise\\nthe president on inter-state disputes.\\nEven the State governments may delegate some of its administrative functions relating to\\nthe State subjects, to Union Government for a specified period.\\nThe Constitution of India has certain special provisions to ensure uniformity of the\\nadministrative system. These include the creation of All India Services such as IAS and\\nIPS and placing members of these services in key administrative positions in the states.\\nThe presence of All India Service Of ficers further paves way for the Central Government\\nto exercise its authority and control over the states. The members of these services are\\nrecruited by the Centre but are appointed in the States. No disciplinary action can be taken\\nagainst them by the State Governments without the permission of the Centre. The\\nConstitution also makes provision for the creation of new All India Service by the Parliament\\non the recommendation of the Rajya Sabha. The President also puts the entire control of\\nthe state administrative machinery under the control of the Union which you will study in\\ndetails while going through the lesson on emergency provisions.\\nYou would also recall that the Union executive is empowered to give such directions to a\\nstate as it may appear necessary for the purpose to the Union Government. The Union\\nGovernment has wide powers to issue directions based on the subjective view of the\\nUnion and may , therefore, interfere with the state autonomy in the field of administration.\\nOrdinarily , the central police force and Army are posted to the states at the request of the\\nState Government. However , there have been occasions when the CRPF of BSF have\\nbeen deployed in states much against the state wishes of the State Government. Thus, the\\ncenter plays a very important role in the administrative sphere of activity concerning the\\nStates.'),\n",

Both the Union and the S tate have been provided\\nwith independent sources of revenue by the Constitution. The Parliament can levy taxes\\non the subjects included in the Union List. The States can levy taxes on the subjects in the\\nState List.

These dangers at the time of independence could be handled\\nonly by a strong government at the Centre.\\nTherefore, the framers of the Constitution assigned a predominant role to the Centre. At\\nthe same time they made provisions for the establishment of a co-operative federalism.\\nThe working of the Indian federation during the last five decades clearly shows that the\\nrelations between the Centre and the States have not always been cordial.\\nThe administrative Reforms Commission and several other Commissions were appointed\\nby the Government of India from time to time to regulate Centre State relations. The\\nUnion Government appointed Sarkaria Commission to suggest ways and means to improve\\nCentre-State relations.\\nThe recommendations of the Sarkaria Commission assume importance so as to evolve an\\nappropriate policy in the areas of legislative, administrative and financial relations.

In addition, it desired that both the Centre and the States\\nshould have the concern for the development of backward territory or areas. If the economic\\ndevelopment of these backward regions are undertaken in a planned manner , the separatist\\ntendencies will be automatically controlled. Differences between the Union and the States\\nshould be resolved by mutual consultation.

All these indicate a tilt\\ntowards strong centre. The states have to work in close co-operation with the centre. The\\nconstitution is federal in form but unitary in spirit. The study of Center-State relationship in\\nlegislative, administrative and financial spheres also clearly shows that the Centre is stronger\\nas compared to the states. The Centre has been assigned a dominant role which became\\nnecessary keeping in view the dangers to the unity and integrity of the nation. Therefore,\\nthere are provisions for a co- operative federalism.\\nThe working of the Indian Constitution over the year indicates that relations between the\\ncenter and the States have not remained very co-ordinal.

There are three types of extraordinary or crisis situations that are envisaged.\\nFirst, when there is a war or external aggression has been committed or there is threat of\\nthe same, or if internal disturbances amounting to armed rebellion take place; second,\\nwhen it becomes impossible for the government of a State to be carried on in accordance\\nwith the Constitution; and third, if the credit or financial stability of the country is threatened.\\nIn each case the President may issue a proclamation with varying consequences. In this\\nsection we will discuss the emergency caused by war etc., popularly known as the national\\nemer gency .\\n9.1.1 Proclamation of National Emergency (Article 352)\\nThe Constitution of India has provided for imposition of emer gency caused by war , external\\naggression or internal rebellion. This is described as the National Emer gency . This type of\\nemergency can be declared by the President of India if he is satisfied that the situation is\\nvery grave and the security of India or any part thereof is threatened or is likely to be\\nthreatened either (i) by war or external aggression or (ii) by armed rebellion within the\\ncountry . The President can issue such a proclamation even on the ground of threat of war\\nor aggression. According to the 44th Amendment of the Constitution, the President can\\ndeclare such an emergency only if the Cabinet recommends in writing to do so.\\nSuch a proclamation of emergency has to be approved by both the Houses of Parliament\\nby absolute majority of the total membership of the Houses as well as 2/3 majority of\\nmembers present and voting within one month, otherwise the proclamation ceases to operate.\\nIn case the Lok Sabha stands dissolved at the time of proclamation of emergency or is not\\nin session, it has to be approved by the Rajya Sabha within one month and later on by the\\nLok Sabha also within one month of the start of its next session. Once approved by the\\nParliament, the emergency remains in force for a period of six months from the date of\\nproclamation. In case it is to be extended beyond six months, another prior resolution has\\nto be passed by the Parliament. In this way , such emer gency continues indefinitely . But if\\nthe situation improves the emergency can be revoked by another proclamation by the\\nPresident of India.\\nThe 44th Amendment of the Constitution provides that ten per cent or more members of\\nthe Lok Sabha can requisition a meeting of the Lok Sabha and in that meeting, it can\\ndisapprove or revoke the emer gency by a simple majority . In such a case emer gency will\\nimmediately become inoperative.\\nNational Emer gency has been declared in our country three times so far . For the first time,\\nemergency was declared on 26 October 1962 after China attacked our borders in the\\nNorth East. This National Emergency lasted till 10 January 1968, long after the hostilities\\nceased.'),\n",

While the second emer gency , on the basis\\nof external aggression, was in operation, third National Emergency (called internal\\nemergency) was imposed on 25 June 1975. This emergency was declared on the ground\\nof ‘internal disturbances’. Internal disturbances justified impositin of the emergency despite\\nthe fact that the government was already armed with the powers provided during the\\nsecond National Emergency of 1971 which was still in operation.\\n9.1.2 Effects of National Emergency\\nThe declaration of National Emergency has far-reaching effects both on the rights of\\nindividuals and the autonomy of the states in the following manner :\\n(i) The most significant effect is that the federal form of the Constitution changes into\\nunitary . The authority of the Centre increases and the Parliament assumes the power\\nto make laws for the entire country or any part thereof, even in respect of subjects\\nmentioned in the State List.\\n(ii) The President of India can issue directions to the states as to the manner in which\\nthe executive power of the states is to be exercised.\\n(iii) During this period, the Lok Sabha can extend its tenure by a period of one year at a\\ntime. But the same cannot be extended beyond six months after the proclamation\\nceases to operate. The tenure of S tate Assemblies can also be extended in the same\\nmanner .\\n(iv) During emer gency , the President is empowered to modify the provisions regarding\\ndistribution of revenues between the Union and the States.\\n(v) The Fundamental Rights under Article 19 about which you have already learnt are\\nautomatically suspended and this suspension continues till the end of the emer gency .\\nBut according to the 44th Amendment, Freedoms listed in Article 19 can be suspended\\nonly in case of proclamation on the ground of war or external aggression.\\nFrom the above discussion, it becomes quite clear that emergency not only suspends the\\nautonomy of the States but also converts the federal structure of India into a unitary one.\\nStill it is considered necessary as it equips the Union Government with vast powers to\\ncope up with the abnormal situations. The exigencies of the situation prevailing in the\\nperiod 1975-77 necessitated certain changes in the Constituion reagarding emergency\\nprovisions. Therefore, the 44th amendment was passed on 30th April 1979 to strengthen\\nthe democratic features of the Indian Constituion and to protect citizens’ rights even during\\nthe national emer gency .\\nIntext Questions 9.1\\nFill in the blanks :\\n1.

Once approved by the Parliament, the National Emergency ordinarily remains in\\nforce for a period of ________________. (six months, 1 year , 2 years).\\n9.2 Emergency due to Failure of Constitutional\\nMachiner y in a S tate\\nIt is the duty of the Union Government to ensure that governance of a State is carried on\\nin accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. Under Article 356, the President\\nmay issue a proclamation to impose emergency in a state if he is satisfied on receipt of a\\nreport from the Governor of the State, or otherwise, that a situation has arisen under\\nwhich the Government of the S tate cannot be carried on smoothly . In such a situation,\\nproclamation of emergency by the President is called ‘proclamation on account of the\\nfailure (or breakdown) of constitutional machinery .’ In popular language it is called the\\nPresident’ s Rule.\\nLike National Emer gency , such a proclamation must also be placed before both the Houses\\nof Parliament for approval. In this case approval must be given within two months, otherwise\\nthe proclamation ceases to operate. If approved by the Parliament, the proclamation remains\\nvalid for six months at a time. It can be extended for another six months but not beyond\\none year . However , emer gency in a S tate can be extended beyond one year if\\n(a) a National Emergency is already in operation; or if\\n(b) the Election Commission certifies that the election to the S tate Assembly cannot be\\nheld.\\nThis type of emergency has been imposed in most of the States at one time or the other for\\na number of times. It was in 1951 that this type of emergency was imposed for the first\\ntime in the Punjab S tate. In 1957, the Kerala S tate was put under the President’ s Rule.\\nThere have been many cases of misuse of ‘constitutional breakdown’. For example, in\\n1977 when Janata Party came into power at the Centre, the Congress Party was almost\\nwiped out in North Indian States. On this excuse, Desai Government at the Centre dismissed\\nnine S tate governments where Congress was still in power . This action of Morarji Desai’ s'),\n",

But, when in 1980\\n(after Janata Government had lost power) Congress came back to power at the Centre\\nunder Mrs.Gandhi’ s leadership and dismissed all the then Janata Party S tate Governments.\\nIn both cases there was no failure of Constitutional machinery , but actions were taken only\\non political grounds.\\nIn 1986, emer gency was imposed in Jammu and Kashmir due to terrorism and insur gency .\\nIn all, there are more than hundred times that emergency has been imposed in various\\nStates for one reason or the other . However , after 1995 the use of this provision has rarely\\nbeen made.\\n9.2.1 Effects of Imposition of Pr esident’ s Rule in a S tate\\nThe declaration of emergency due to the breakdown of Constitutional machinery in a\\nState has the following effects:\\n(i) The President can assume to himself all or any of the functions of the State\\nGovernment or he may vest all or any of those functions with the Governor or any\\nother executive authority .\\n(ii) The President may dissolve the S tate Legislative Assembly or put it under suspension.\\nHe may authorise the Parliament to make laws on behalf of the State Legislature.\\n(iii) The President can make any other incidental or consequential provision necessary to\\ngive effect to the object of proclamation.\\nThe way President ’s Rule was imposed on various occasions has raised many questions.\\nAt times the situation really demanded it. But at other times, President’ s Rule was imposed\\npurely on political grounds to topple the ministry formed by a party different from the one\\nat the Centre, even if that particular party enjoyed majority in the Legislative Assembly .\\nSuspending or dissolving assemblies and not giving a chance to the other political parties to\\nform governments in states has been due to partisan consideration of the Union Government,\\nfor which Article 356 has been clearly misused.\\nIn view of the above facts, Article 356 has become very controversial. In spite of the\\nsafeguards provided by the 44th Amendment Act, this provision has been alleged to be\\nmisused by the Union Government. That is why , there is a demand either for its deletion or\\nmaking provision in the Constitution to restrict the misuse of this Article. The Sarkaria\\nCommission which was appointed to review the Centre–State relations also recommended\\nthat Article 356 should be used only as a last resort. The Commission also suggested that\\nthe S tate Legislative Assembly should not be dissolved unless the proclamation is approved\\nby the Parliament. It further suggested that all possibilities of forming an alternative\\ngovernment should be fully explored before the Centre imposes emergency in a State on\\ngrounds of breakdown of Constitutional machinery . The Supreme Court held in the Bommai\\ncase that the Assembly may not be dissolved till the Proclamation is approved by the\\nParliament. On a few occasions such as when Gujral Government recommended use of\\nArticle 356 in Uttar Pradesh, the President returned the recommendation for reconsideration.\\nThe Union Government took the h int and dropped the proposal.'),\n",

(Union Government employees, State\\nGovernment employees, All government functionaries including judges.)\\nWhat You Have Learnt\\nAccording to the Indian Constitution, the President has been given extraordinary powers\\nto deal with certain abnormal situations in order to protect the security , integrity and stability\\nof the country . For this purpose, there are three types of emer gencies which can be\\nproclaimed by the President of India on the written advice of the Union Cabinet. These\\nthree types of emergencies are :\\n(a) National emergency (Article 352).\\n(b) Emergency due to the breakdown of constitutional machinery in a State (Article\\n356).\\n(c) Financial emergency (Article 360).\\nNational emer gency under Article 352 has been declared three times so far . Twice it was\\nimposed due to the external aggression once by China and another time by Pakistan,\\nwhereas it was declared only once on the basis of the fear of internal disturbances. This\\nemergency was imposed on 25 June 1975. Emergency on account of failure of Constitutional\\nmachinery has been declared in most of the S tates some time or the other . But Financial\\nEmer gency has not been declared so far .\\nEmer gency , when imposed, af fects the Fundamental Rights of the citizens. It also af fects\\nthe autonomy of the State  Governments. The powers of the Union Government increase\\nand it can make laws even on the subjects included in the State List. The Centre gives\\ndirections to the State Governments. Practically speaking, the federal nature of the\\nConstitution changes into a unitary form. So much so that when the proclamation of national\\nemergency is in operation, some of the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by the Constitution\\nremain suspended.\\nThe second type of emer gency under Article 356 is the most frequently imposed emer gency .\\nUnder this, a S tate is put under the President’ s Rule if the elected representatives fail to\\nform or run the government in a State according to the Constitution of India. This is the\\nmost misused form of emer gency which has been vehemently criticised by many .\\nThe third type of emer gency is Financial Emer gency which has not been declared so far .\\nDuring this type of emer gency , the President of India may give directions to the Union as\\nwell as State Governments to re duce the salaries and allowances of their employees\\nincluding the judges. The purpose of declaring this type of emergency is to solve the\\nfinancial crises.'),\n",

However the of fice of the President, the Vice-President, the Governor or\\nthe Minister of the Union or the State is not considered as an office of profit for this\\npurpose;\\nThe President cannot at the same time be a member of Parliament or of a State\\nLegislature. If a member of Parliament or State Legislature is elected as President\\nhis/her seat will be deemed to have been vacated on the date, he/she assumes office\\nas President of India.\\n10.1.1 Election Procedure\\nThe President is elected by an Electoral College consisting of the elected members of both\\nHouses of Parliament i.e. Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha and of the State Legislative\\nAssemblies (V idhan Sabhas). Nominated members of Parliament and members of S tate\\nLegislative Councils are not members of the Electoral College. The election is held by\\nmeans of single transferable vote system of proportional representation. The voting is\\ndone by secret ballot.\\nThe framers of the Constitution were keen to obtain parity between the votes of the\\nelected members of Parliament on one side and elected members of Legislative Assemblies\\nof all the S tates on the other . They devised a system to determine the value of vote of each\\nmember of Parliament and Legislative Assembly , so as to ensure equality .\\nThe value of vote of each member  of Legislative Assembly of a state is\\ndetermined by the formula as given below:-\\n= Total population of the State 1000 \\nNumber of elected members of State Legislative Assembly ÷\\nIn simple words the total population of the State is divided by the number of elected\\nmembers of the S tate Legislative Assembly , and the quotient is divided by 1000.\\nExample:  Let us suppose that the population of Punjab is 1,35,51,060 and the number of\\nmembers of S tate Vidhan Sabha is 104. The votes which each Legislature is entitled to\\ncast will be:-\\n 1,35,51,000 1000 104 ÷\\n= 130.29\\n= 130 [As the remainder .29 is less than 50%, it is ignored]\\nThe value of each vote of a Member of Parliament  is determined by adding all the\\nvotes of members of the S tate Legislative Assemblies including the Legislative Assemblies'),\n",

Let us suppose\\nthat the total number of votes of all the Legislators is 5,44,971 and the total number of\\nelected members of Parliament is 776. Then the number of votes of each member of\\nParliament will be\\n = 5,44,971 \\n776  = 702.28\\n = 702\\nAt both the stages if the remainder is less than 50% of the divides, it is ignored. But when\\nthe remainder is 50% or more, one vote is added to the quotient.\\nSingle Transferable Vote System:  The election of the President is held through single\\ntransferable vote system of proportional representation. Under this system names of all\\nthe candidates are listed on the ballot paper and the elector gives them numbers according\\nto his/her preference. Every voter may mark on the ballot paper as many preferences as\\nthere are candidates. Thus the elector shall place the figure 1 opposite the name of the\\ncandidate whom he/she chooses for first preference and may mark as many preferences\\nas he/she wishes by putting the figures 2,3,4 and so on against the names of other candidates.\\nThe ballot becomes invalid if first preference is marked against more than one candidate\\nor if the first preference is not marked at all.\\nCounting of Votes and Declaration of Result\\nMembers of S tate Legislative Assemblies cast their votes in S tates Capitals, while Members\\nof Parliament cast their votes in Delhi in the States Capitals. Counting of votes is done at\\nNew Delhi. First preference votes of all the candidates are sorted out and counted. To be\\ndeclared elected a candidate must get more than 50% of the total valid votes polled. This\\nis known as Quota. The Quota is determined by totalling the total number of votes polled\\ndivided by the number of candidates to be elected plus one. In this case, since only the\\nPresident is to be elected, so division is done by 1+1. One (01) is added to the quotient to\\nmake it more than 50%.\\n Quota = Total number of votes polled 11 1 ++\\nAt the first count only first preference votes are counted. If any of the candidates reaches\\nthe quota, he/she is declared elected. In case no candidate reaches the quota, then the 2nd\\npreference votes of the candidate getting the least number of first preference votes are\\ntransferred to other candidates. Thus the candidate getting the least number of votes is\\neliminated. If after counting, a candidate reaches quota, he/she is declared elected as the\\nPresident. In case no candidate reaches quota, even at this stage, then the votes of next\\ncandidate getting the least number of votes are transferred to the others. It continues till\\nany one candidate gets the quota of votes.'),\n",

If the charges are\\naccepted by a two-third majority of the total membership of the second House, the\\nimpeachment succeeds. The President thus stands removed from the office from the date\\non which the resolution is passed.\\nThis procedure of impeachment is even more dif ficult than the one adopted in America\\nwhere only simple majority is required in the House of Representatives to initiate the\\nproceedings.'),\n",

Broadly the powers of the\\nPresident can be classified as Executive, Legislative, Financial and Judicial Powers. His\\nemergency powers are already dealt with in Lesson No. 9.\\n10.3.1 Executive Powers\\nThe President is head of State and executive powers of the Union have been vested in\\nhim. The President is empowered to exercise these powers either directly or through\\nofficers subordinate to him which means through the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers\\nalso. His executive powers are given below:-\\nThe President appoints the Prime Minister and he appoints other ministers on the\\nadvice of the Prime Minister . He allocates portfolios among the ministers on the\\nadvice of the Prime Minister . He may remove any Minister on the advice of the\\nPrime Minister .\\nThe President appoints the Chief Justice and other judges of the Supreme Court and High\\nCourts. However , in all judicial appointments, the Chief Justice of India is consulted. Besides\\nthe President may also consult such other judges of the Supreme Court as the President\\nmay be deemed necessary . While appointing Chief Justice and justices of High Courts the\\nPresident has to consult the State Governor also. In the appointment of High Court judges,\\nthe President also consults the Chief Justice of the State. But now in accordance with the\\n1993 decision of the Supreme Court as re-interpreted in 1999 (see Lesson 12), the President\\nis bound by the recommendations of a panel of senior most judges of the Supreme Court\\nin matters of all judicial appointments. This panel headed by the Chief Justice is known as\\nthe collegium of the Supreme Court. The President appoints the Attorney General, the\\nComptroller and Auditor General of India, the Chief Election Commissioner and other\\nElection Commissioners, the Chairman and Members of Union Public Service Commission\\n(U.P.S.C.). He/she also appoints the Governors of S tates and Lt. Governors of Union\\nTerritories.

These\\npowers are given below:\\nThe President summons, and prorogues the Houses of Parliament. He may summon the\\nParliament at least twice a year , and the gap between two sessions cannot be more than\\nsix months. The President has the power to dissolve the Lok Sabha even before the expiry\\nof its term on the recommendation of the Prime Minister . In normal course he/she dissolves\\nLok Sabha after five years. The President nominates twelve members to Rajya Sabha\\nfrom amongst persons having special knowledge in the field of literature, science, art and\\nsocial service. The President may also nominate two members of Anglo-Indian community\\nto the Lok Sabha in case that community is not adequately represented in the House. The\\nPresident can call a joint sitting of the two Houses of Parliament in case of a disagreement\\nbetween Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on a non-money bill. So far thrice such joint sittings\\nhave been summoned (see Lesson no. 1 1). The President has the right to address and\\nsend messages to Parliament. The President addresses both Houses of Parliament jointly\\nat the first session after every general election as well as commencement of the first\\nsession every year . These addresses contain policies of the government of the day .\\nEvery bill passed by Parliament is sent to the President for his/her assent. The President\\nmay give his/her assent, or return it once for the reconsideration of the Parliament. If\\npassed again the President has to give her assent. Without his/her assent no bill can become\\na law . The President may promulgate an ordinance when the Parliament is not in session.\\nThe ordinance so issued has the force of law . The ordinance so promulgated should be laid\\nbefore both Houses of Parliament when they reassemble. If it is neither rejected by the\\nParliament nor withdrawn by the President, it automatically lapses six weeks after the\\ncommencement of the next session of Parliament. Generally a b ill is moved by the\\nGovernment to enact a law in place of the ordinance.\\n10.3.3 Financial Powers\\nAll money bills are introduced in the Lok Sabha only with the prior approval of the President.\\nThe President  has the control over Contingency Fund of India. It enables her to advance\\nmoney for the purpose of meeting unforeseen expenses. Annual budget and railway budget\\nare introduced in the Lok Sabha on the recommendation of the President. If the Government\\nin the middle of the financial year feels that more money is required than estimated in the\\nannual budget, it can present supplementary demands. Money bills are never returned for\\nreconsiderations. The President appoints the Finance Commission after every five years.\\nIt makes recommendations to the President on some specific financial matters, especially\\nthe distribution of Central taxes between the Union and the States. The President  also\\nreceives the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor -General of India, and has it laid in the\\nParliament.\\nContingency Fund of India:  It is a fund kept by the Union Government to meet\\nany unforeseen expenditure for which money is immediately needed.

The President can pardon a person convicted\\nby a Court Martial. His/her power of pardon includes granting of pardon even to a person\\nawarded death sentence. But, the President performs this function on the advice of Law\\nMinistry .\\nThe President enjoys certain immunities. He is above the law and no criminal proceedings\\ncan be initiated against him/her (see section 10.2.1 above).\\n10.4 Position of the President\\nThe office of the President is of high dignity and eminence, not of real powers. The\\npowers formally vested in him/her are actually exercised not by his/her , but by the Union\\nCouncil of Ministers, in his/her name. If the President  tries to act against the wishes of the\\nministers, the President  may create a constitutional crisis. The President  may even face\\nimpeachment and may have to quit. Thus, the President has no alternative but to act in\\naccordance with the advice of the Prime Minister , who after all is head of the real executive.\\nThe Prime Minister is in regular touch with the President.\\nThe Council of Ministers is responsible to Lok Sabha, and can be removed on its adverse\\nvote only . In practice the ministers do not hold of fice during the pleasure of the President.\\nThe Constitu tion, 42nd Amendment Act has made it obligatory for the President to act only\\non the advice of the Council of Ministers. The President  cannot act independently .\\nHis/her powers are formal. It is the Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister\\nwhich is the real executive. In accordance with the 44th Amendment Act of the Constitution,\\nthe President can send back a bill passed by the Parliament for reconsideration only once.\\nIf the bill is again passed by the Parliament, the President has to give his assent to the bill.\\nIn the Constituent Assembly , Dr. B.R. Ambedkar had rightly said, “The President occupies\\nthe same position as the King in the British Constitution”. But in reality the President of\\nIndia is not a mere rubber stamp. The Constitution lays down that the President has to\\npreserve, protect and defend the Constitution. The President  can ask a newly appointed\\nPrime Minister to seek a vote of confidence in the Lok Sabha within a stipulated period of\\ntime. All the administration of the country is carried on in her name. The President  can ask\\nfor any information from any minister . All the decisions of the Cabinet are communicated\\nto the President. The President  is furnished with all the information relating to administration.\\nIt is in this context that the utility of the office of the President comes to be fully realised\\nwhen the President  gives suggestions, encourages and even warns the government. It is in\\nthis context, the President emer ges as an advisor , a friend and even a critic.\\nBy way of conclusion, we may describe the position of the President in the words of Dr .\\nB.R. Ambedkar . According to him/her , the President is the Head of S tate but not the\\nexecutive. The President  represents the nation but does not ru le over the nation.

The\\nConstitution provides that “there shall be a Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister at\\nthe head to aid and advise the President in the excercise of his functions”. Here the word\\n“shall” indicates that the President cannot function without the Council of Ministers. The\\nPresident is the constitutional head of State, but the real Head of the government is the\\nPrime Minister .\\n10.6.1 Appointment of the Prime Minister\\nThe Prime Minister is appointed by the President but the President  does not have freedom\\nin the selection of the Prime Minister . Normally the President  has to invite leader of the\\nmajority party to form the government. In case no single party is in clear majority , the\\nPresident  invites the person who is likely to command support of two or more parties\\nwhich make up majority in the Lok Sabha. Once appointed, the Prime Minister holds\\noffice so long as he/she enjoys the support of the majority of members of Lok Sabha. The\\nPrime Minister is normally leader of the majority party in Lok Sabha. However , there have\\nbeen cases when a member of Rajya Sabha was made the Prime Minister . This happened\\nwhen Mrs. Indira Gandhi was first appointed, Prime Minster in 1966, or when I. K. Gujral\\nbecame Prime Minister in 1997 or when Rajya Sabha member Dr . Manmohan Singh\\nbecame the Prime Minister in 2004. In 1996 H.D. Deve Gowda was not a member of any\\nHouse. He later entered the Rajya Sabha.\\nMembers of the Council of Ministers are appointed by the President on the advice of the\\nPrime Minister . While selecting the ministers, the Prime Minister the PM keeps in mind\\nthat due representation to dif ferent regions of the country , to various religious and caste\\ngroups. In a coalition government, the members of coalition parties have to be given due\\nrepresentation in the Council of Ministers. The Prime Minister decides portfolios of the\\nMinisters, and can alter these at his will.\\nIn order to be a Minister , a person has to be a member of either of the two Houses of\\nParliament. Even a person who is not a member of any of the two Houses can become a\\nMinister for a period of six months. Within six months the Minister has to get himself/\\nherself elected to either House of Parliament, failing which he/she ceases to be a Minister .\\nAll the Ministers are collectively as well as individually responsible to the Lok Sabha.\\nThe Council of Ministers consists of two category of ministers. These are: Cabinet Ministers\\nand Ministers of State. The Cabinet Ministers are usually senior members of the party/\\ncoalition of parties. The Ministers of State come next to Cabinet Ministers. Some of the\\nMinisters of State have independent charge of a department while other Ministers of State\\nonly assist the Cabinet Ministers. Sometimes even deputy ministers are also appointed to\\nassist the ministers.\\nMinisters other than Cabinet Ministers normally do not attend the meetings of the Cabinet.\\nThe Prime Minister presides over the meetings of the Cabinet. All policy matters are\\ndecided by the Cabinet. The Prime Minister has the authority to reshuffle the portfolios of\\nthe Ministers or even ask for their resignation. In case of resignation or death of the Prime\\nMinister the entire Council of Ministers also goes out of office. This is because the Council\\nof Ministers is created by the Prime Minister , who also heads it. The entire Council of\\nMinisters is responsibility to the Lok Sabha (see below 10.8)'),\n",

His/her role is unparalled and the President gives direction to the\\ngovernance of the country .\\nThe Prime Minister being the head of the Council of Ministers, selects the Ministers to be\\nsworn in by the President. The Ministers in fact are chosen by the Prime Minister and\\nremain Ministers as long as they enjoy the confidence of the Prime Minister . The Prime\\nMinister distributes portfolios among Ministers. The President can change the portfolios\\nas and when he desires. The Prime Minister can drop a Minister or ask for his/her\\nresignation.\\nThe Prime Minister presides over the meetings of the Cabinet and conducts its proceedings.\\nAs head of the Cabinet, he/she largely influences the decisions of the Cabinet. The Prime\\nMinister co-ordinates the working of various ministers. The President resolves disagreement\\nif any amongst different Ministers. Prime Minister is the link between the President and\\nthe Cabinet. The decisions of the Cabinet are conveyed to the President by the Prime\\nMinister . It is he who keeps the President informed of all the policies and decisions of the\\nGovernment. No Minister can meet the President without the permission of the Prime\\nMinister . All important appointments are made by the President on the advice of the Prime\\nMinister . It is on the advice of the Prime Minister that the President summons and prorogues\\nthe session of the Parliament and even dissolves the Lok Sabha.\\nThe Prime Minister is the “principal spokesman” and defender of the policies of the\\nGovernment in the Parliament. When any Minister is unable to defend his/her actions\\nproperly , the Prime Minister comes to the help of that Minister both inside and outside the\\nParliament. The Prime Minister is the leader of the nation. The nation looks to his/her for\\nguidance. At the time of general elections, it is the Prime Minister who seeks mandate of\\nthe people. The Prime Minister plays an important role in the formulation of domestic and\\nforeign policies. The President represents the country in the world arena, by participating\\nin the international meetings such as NAM, SAARC and United Nations. All international\\nagreements and treaties with other countries are concluded with the consent of the Prime\\nMinister . The President is the Chief spokesperson of the policies of the country .\\nThe Prime Minister has a special status both in the Government and in the Parliament.\\nThis makes him/her the most powerful functionary . His/her position and powers depend\\nupon his/her personality . A person of the stature of Jawaharlal Nehru or Indira Gandhi, is\\nalways more effective than a person who lacks vision or depends on support from outside\\nhis party . The Prime Minister is not only leader of the Parliament but also leader of the\\nnation. The Prime Minister has to secure the willing cooperation of all important members\\nof his/her own party . In a minority government, the Prime Minister has to depend on\\noutside help that might act as hindrance in his effective role.\\n10.7 The Council of Ministers and The Cabinet\\nThe terms Council of Ministers and ‘The Cabinet’ are often used as inter-changeable\\nterms. In reality , they are not. Prior to 44th Amendment of the Constitution, the word\\n‘Cabinet’ was not mentioned in the Constitution. Let us distinguish between the Council of'),\n",

The main points of difference are: The Council of Ministers\\nconsists of all category of Ministers i.e., Cabinet Ministers and Ministers of State. The\\nCabinet on the other hand consists of Senior Ministers only . Its number varies from 15 to\\n30 while the entire Council of Ministers can consist of even more than 70. The Council of\\nMinisters as a whole rarely meets. The Cabinet on the other hand meets as frequently as\\npossible. It is the Cabinet that determines the policies and programmes of the Government\\nand not the Council of Ministers. Thus, ‘Cabinet is an inner body within the Council of\\nMinisters’. It acts in the name of the Council of Ministers and exercises all powers on its\\nbehalf.\\n10.7.1 Powers and Functions of the Cabinet\\nIt has enormous powers and manifold responsibilities. All the executive powers of the\\nPresident are exercised by the Cabinet headed by the Prime Minister .\\nThe Cabinet determines and formulates the internal and external policies of the country .

It has also to\\nformulate policies so as to provide better living conditions for the people.Cabinet has control\\nover national finance. The Cabinet is responsible for whole of the expenditure of the\\ngovernment as well for raising necessary revenues. It is the Cabinet that prepares the text\\nof President’ s address to the Parliament. The Cabinet is also responsible for the issuance\\nof Ordinances by the President when the Parliament is not in session.

But, in fact, they are responsible to, and removable by the Lok\\nSabha. Actually the Constitution has itself declared that the Council of Ministers shall be\\nresponsible to the Lok Sabha (not to both the Houses). Ministerial responsibility is the\\nessential feature of parliamentary form of government. The principle of ministerial\\nresponsibility has two dimensions: collective responsibility and individual responsibility .\\n10.8.1 Collective Responsibility\\nOur Constitution clearly says that “The Council of Ministers shall be collectively responsible\\nto ‘House of the People’.” It actually means that the Ministers are responsible to the Lok\\nSabha not as individuals alone, but collectively also. Collective responsibility has two\\nimplications. Firstly , it means that every member of the Council of ministers accepts\\nresponsibility for each and every decision of the Cabinet. Members of the Council of\\nMinisters swim and sink together . When a decision has been taken by the Cabinet, every\\nMinister has to stand by it without any hesitation. If a Minister does not agree with the\\nCabinet decision, the only alternative left to him/her is to resign from the Council of Ministers.\\nThe essence of collective responsibility means that, ‘the Minister must vote with the\\ngovernment, speak in defence of it if the Prime Minister insists, and he/she cannot afterwards\\nreject criticism of his act, either in Parliament or in the constituencies, on the ground that\\nhe/she did not agree with the decision.’  Secondly , vote of no-confidence against the Prime\\nMinister is a vote against the whole Council of Ministers. Similarly , adverse vote in the Lok\\nSabha on any government bill or budget implies lack of confidence in the entire Council of\\nMinisters, not only the mover of the bill.\\n10.8.2 Individual Responsibility\\nThough the Ministers are collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha, they are also individually\\nresponsible to the Lok Sabha. Individual responsibility is enforced when an action taken by\\na Minister without the concurrence of the Cabinet, or the Prime Minister , is criticised and\\nnot approved by the Parliament. Similarly if personal conduct of a Minister is questionable\\nand unbecoming he may have to resign without affecting the fate of the Government. If a\\nMinister becomes a liability or embarrassment to the Prime Minister , he may be asked to\\nquit.\\nNO-CONFIDENCE MOTION :- It is a motion moved by a member of legislature\\nexpressing no-confidence of the House in the Council of Ministers. If adopted by the\\nlegislature, the Council of Ministers has to resign.\\nWhat You Have Learnt\\nIndia has adopted parliamentary form of government where the President is the constitutional\\nhead of state. The Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister is the real executive.\\nThe President of India is indirectly elected by an Electoral College consisting of elected\\nmembers of both Houses of Parliament and the elected members of State Legislative\\nAssemblies (V idhan Sabhas) by means of single transferable vote system of proportional\\nrepresentation. The President is elected through a complicated system which ensures\\nequal voice (value of votes) of the national Parliament on the one side and all the State\\nLegislative Assemblies on the other .\\nThe President is elected for a term of five years. The President is eligible for reelection.'),\n",

In a parliamentary form of government the\\nParliament is the most important organ. It is the people who elect their representatives to\\nbe members of the Parliament and these representatives legislate and control the executive\\non behalf of the people. The Prime Minister and his Council of Ministers remain at the\\nhelm of affairs so long as they enjoy the confidence of Lok Sabha. The Parliament (Lok\\nSabha) may dislodge them from power by expressing a no confidence against the Prime\\nMinister and his Council of Ministers. Thus the Parliament occupies a central position in\\nour parliamentary system.\\nObjectives\\nAfter studying this lesson, you will be able to\\n/circle6 recall that the Parliament of India consists of the President and the two Houses;Y\\nA view of Indian Parliament'),\n",

Rajya Sabha is upper\\nHouse and represents the States of India while the Lok Sabha is lower House. It is also\\ncalled popular House because it represents the people of India. The President is an integral\\npart of the Parliament though he is not a member of the either House. As an integral part\\nof the Parliament, the President has been assigned certain powers and functions, which\\nyou have read in the last lesson. In this lesson you will study about the two Houses in\\ndetails.\\n11.1.1. Rajya Sabha: Membership and Election\\nRajya Sabha or the Upper House of the Parliament is a permanent body as it cannot be\\ndissolved. The membership of the Rajya Sabha cannot exceed 250. Out of these, the\\nPresident nominates 12 members on the basis of their excellence in literature, science, art\\nand social service and the rest are elected. At present its total membership is 245.\\nRajya Sabha is the body representing States in Indian Union. The elected members of the\\nStates’  Legislative Assemblies elect the members of the Rajya Sabha on the basis of\\nproportional representation through the single transferable vote system. But all the States\\ndo not send equal number of members to the Rajya Sabha. Their representation is decided\\non the basis of population of respective States. Thus the bigger State gets bigger\\nrepresentation and the smaller ones have lesser representation. While the big State like\\nUP has been assigned 31 seats, the smaller states like Sikkim and Tripura send only one\\nmember each. Delhi Assembly elects three members of Rajya Sabha and Pondichery\\nsends one member . Other Union Territories are not represented in the Rajya Sabha.\\n11.1.2 Qualifications\\nThe qualifications for becoming a Rajya Sabha member are as follows:\\n1. He/she should be a citizen of India and at least 30 years of age.\\n2. He/she should make an oath or affirmation stating that he will bear true faith and\\nallegiance to the Constitution of India.\\n3. Thus according to the Representation of People Act 1951, he/she should be registered\\nas a voter in the State from which he is seeking election to the Rajya Sabha. But in\\n2003, two provisions have been made regarding the elections to Rajya Sabha- (i) Any\\nIndian citizen can contest the Rajya Sabha elections irrespective of the State in which\\nhe resides; (ii) elections are to be conducted through open voting system.\\n11.1.3 Tenur e\\nEvery member of Rajya Sabha enjoys a safe tenure of six years. One-third of its members'),\n",

They are entitled to contest again for the membership. But a\\nmember elected against a mid-term vacancy serves the remaining period only . This system\\nof election ensures continuity in the working of Rajya Sabha.\\n11.1.4 Of ficials of Rajya Sabha\\nThe Vice-President of India is the ex-of ficio Chairman of the Rajya Sabha. He/she presides\\nover the meetings of Rajya Sabha. In his absence the Deputy Chairman, who is elected by\\nits members from amongst themselves, presides over the meeting of the House. The\\nDeputy Chairman can be removed by a majority of all the then members of Rajya Sabha.\\nBut the Chairman (V ice-President) can only be removed from his of fice by a resolution\\npassed by a majority of all the then members of Rajya Sabha and agreed to by the Lok\\nSabha.\\nAs the Vice-President is an ex-of ficio Chairman and not a member of Rajya Sabha, he/\\nshe is normally not entitled to vote. He/she can vote only in case of a tie.\\nTie means a situation in which there are equal vote cast in favour and against a bill\\nor resolution. In such a situation the presiding officer may exercise a casting vote in\\nfavour/against to break the tie.\\nIntext Questions 1 1.1\\n1. What can be the maximum strength of Rajya Sabha?\\n2. How many members the President nominates in Rajya Sabha?\\n3. Who can vote to elect the members of Rajya Sabha?\\n4. What is the tenure of a member of Rajya Sabha?\\n5. What is the minimum age for becoming a member of Rajya Sabha?\\n6. Who is the ex-officio Chairman of Rajya Sabha?\\n11.1.5 Membership and Election of the Lok Sabha\\nUnlike Rajya Sabha, Lok Sabha is not a permanent body . It is elected directly by the\\npeople on the basis of universal adult franchise. It is also called the popular House or\\nlower House. The maximum permissible membership of Lok Sabha is 550 out of which\\n530 are directly elected from the States while 20 members are elected from the Union\\nTerritories. Besides, the President may nominate two members from the Anglo-Indian\\ncommunity if he/she feels that the said community is not adequately represented in the\\nHouse.\\nCertain number of seats have been reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes\\nin the Lok Sabha. Initially this provision was made for ten years from the commencement\\nof the Constitution, which has been extended time and again for further ten years by\\nvarious constitutional amendments. The 79th Amendment has extended it for sixty years\\nfrom the commencement of the Constitution. Reservation of seats for the Scheduled Castes\\nor Scheduled Tribes means the persons belonging to SC/ST  will represent such reserved\\nseats. That implies that only persons belonging to SC/ST can contest from the reserved\\nconstituencies. But we have joint electorate and all the voters of the reserved constituency'),\n",

There is no separation of voters in terms of caste or\\ntribe.\\nThe representation to the Lok Sabha is based on population. Therefore UP which is the\\nmost heavily populated State in India sends as many as 80 members while smaller States\\nlike Mizoram, Nagaland and Sikkim send just one representative each to the Lok Sabha.\\nSeven members represent Delhi.\\nFor the purpose of elections to the Lok Sabha, the States are divided into single member\\nconstituencies on the basis of population.\\n11.1.6 Qualifications\\nAll the citizens of 18 years of age and above are entitled to vote in the elections to Lok\\nSabha subject to the laws made by the Parliament. Any Indian citizen can become a\\nmember of Lok Sabha provided he/she fulfils the following qualifications:\\n1. He/she should be not less than 25 years of age.\\n2. He/she should declare through an oath or affirmation that he has true faith and\\nallegiance in the Constitution and that he will uphold the sovereignty and integrity of\\nIndia.\\n3. He/she must possess such other qualifications as may be laid down by the Parliament\\nby law . He must be registered as a voter in any constituency in India.\\n4. Person contesting from the reserved seat should belong to the Scheduled Caste or\\nScheduled Tribe as the case may be.\\n11.1.7 Tenur e\\nThe normal term of Lok Sabha is five years. But the President, on the advice of Council of\\nMinisters, may dissolve it before the expiry of five years. In the case of national emer gency ,\\nits term can be extended for one year at a time. But it will not exceed six months after the\\nemer gency is over . On several occasions Lok Sabha was dissolved prior to the end of its\\nterm. For example the 12th Lok Sabha elected in 1998 was dissolved in 1999.\\n11.1.8 Of ficials of the Lok Sabha\\nThe Speaker and the Deputy Speaker:  The presiding officer of Lok Sabha is known\\nas Speaker . The members of the House elect him. He/she remains the Speaker even after\\nLok Sabha is dissolved till the next House elects a new Speaker in his place. In she\\nabsence, a Deputy Speaker who is also elected by the House presides over the meetings.\\nBoth the Speaker as well as the Deputy Speaker can be removed from office by a resolution\\nof Lok Sabha passed by a majority of all the then members of the House.\\nSome of the powers and functions of the speaker are given below :\\n1. The basic function of the Speaker is to preside over the house and conduct the meetings\\nof the House in orderly manner . No member can speak in the House without she\\npermission. He/she may ask a member to finish his speech and in case the member\\ndoes not obey he/she may order that the speech should not be recorded.\\n2.

For which section of the society seats are reserved in the Lok Sabha?\\n5. Who can vote in Lok Sabha elections?\\n6. Who can dissolve the Lok Sabha?\\n7. Who elects the Speaker of Lok Sabha?\\n11.2 Functions of Parliament\\nThe functions and powers of the Indian Parliament can be divided into legislative, executive,\\nfinancial and other catagories.\\n11.2.1 Legislative Functions\\nBasically the Parliament is a law-making body . In an earlier lesson you have seen that\\nthere is a division of power betw een the Centre (Union) and the States. There are three\\nlists – Union List, State List and the Concurrent List. Only Parliament can make laws on\\nthe subjects mentioned in the Union List. You know that the Union List has 97 subjects.\\nAlong with the State Legislatures, the Parliament is empowered to make laws on the\\nConcurrent List. In case, both the Centre as well as the States make a law on the subject\\nmentioned in the Concurrent List then the central law prevails upon the state law if there\\nis a clash between the two. Any subject not mentioned in any list i.e. residuary powers are\\nvested with the Parliament.\\nThus the law making power of the Parliament is very wide. It covers the Union List and\\nConcurrent List and in certain circumstances even the State List also.\\n11.2.2 The Executive Functions\\nIn a parliamentary system of government there is a close relationship between the legislature\\nand the executive. And the executive is responsible to the legislature for all its acts. The'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Hp\\\\Documents\\\\vscode\\\\prepbridge\\\\prepbridge\\\\data\\\\indian-polity.pdf', 'page': 121}, page_content='MODULE - 3\\nNotes\\n120Political Science\\nStructur e of Government Prime Minister and his Council of Ministers are responsible to the Parliament individually\\nas well as collectively . The Parliament can dislodge a ministry by passing a vote of no-\\nconfidence or by refusing to endorse a confidence motion. In India this has happened\\nseveral times. This happened in 1999 when the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Government lost the\\nconfidence motion in the Lok Sabha by just one vote and resigned.\\nBut the no-confidence motion or the confidence motions are the extreme ways of maintaining\\nthe accountability of the Parliament over the executive. They are employed in exceptional\\ncases. Parliament also maintains its control over executive in a routine manner through\\nseveral ways. Some of them are as follows:-\\na. The members of Parliament can ask questions and supplementary questions regarding\\nany matters connected with the affairs of the Central Government. The first hour of\\nevery working day of Parliament relates to the Question Hour in which the Ministers\\nhave to answer the questions raised by the members.\\nb. If the members are not satisfied with the Government’ s answer then they may demand\\nseparate discussion on the subject.\\nc. The Parliament also exercises control over the executive through several motions.\\nFor example calling attention notice or adjournment motion are such ways by which\\nsome recent matters of urgent public importance are raised. The government always\\ntakes these motions very seriously because the government’ s policies are criticized\\nseverely and their likely impact on the electorate whom the government would have\\nto face ultimately . If the motion is passed then it means that the government is censured.\\nCensure Motion:  This motion implies severe indictment of the government; but\\nit does not require resignation of the Council of Members.\\nd. The Lok Sabha can express its lack of confidence in the executive by disapproving\\nbudget or money bill or even an ordinary bill.\\n11.2.3 The Financial Functions\\nThe Parliament performs important financial functions. It is the custodian of the public\\nmoney . It controls the entire purse of the Central Government. No money can be spent\\nwithout its approval. This approval may be taken before the actual spending or in rare\\ncases after the spending. The budget is approved by the Parliament every year .\\n11.2.4 The Electoral Functions\\nThe elected member of Parliament one members of the Electoral College for Presidential\\nelection. As such, they participate in the election of the President of India. They elect the\\nVice-President. The Lok Sabha elects its Speaker and Deputy Speaker and the Rajya\\nSabha elects its Deputy Chairman.\\n11.2.5 Power  of Removal\\nCertain high funtionaries may be removed from office on the initiative of the Parliament.\\nThe President of India may be removed through the process of impeachment (you have\\nread about it in Lesson No. 10). The judges of Supreme Court and of High Courts can be\\nremoved by an order of the President, which may be issued only if a resolution of their\\nremoval is passed by both Houses of Parliament by special majority (see Lessons 12 and\\n15).'),\n",

The Supreme Court has ruled that the Parliament cannot change the basic structure\\nof the Constitution. You have already read about the amending procedure in another lesson.\\n11.2.7 Miscellaneous Functions\\nBesides the above-mentioned functions, the Parliaments also performs a variety of other\\nfunctions. Some of them are as follows: -\\na. While it is the power of the President to declare Emer gency , the Parliament approves\\nall such Proclamations of Emer gency . Both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha have to\\napprove the Proclamation.\\nb. Parliament may form a new State by separating the territory from any State or by\\nuniting two or more States.

Parliament may admit or establish new States in the Indian Union (Sikkim in 1975).\\nd. The Parliament can abolish or create Legislative Councils in the States. This is done\\nonly on the request of concerned S tates Assemblies.\\nThus the Indian Parliament, though limited by the federal nature of the political system,\\nhas wide functions to perform. In performing its functions, it has to mirror the aspirations\\nand needs of the people of India. It also has to function as an agency for resolving socio-\\neconomic or political conflicts in the country . It also helps in building consensus on specific\\nissues, which are crucial to the nation like foreign policy formulation.\\nIntext Questions 1 1.3\\n1.

A\\nMinister moves a government bill and any bill not moved by a Minister is a Private Member ’s\\nBill, which means that the bill has been moved by a member of parliament but not a\\nminister in the Government. The Government bills consume most of the time of the\\nParliament. The Bills pass through several stages. : -\\n(A) With the introduction of the bill, the First Reading of the bill starts. This stage is\\nsimple. The Minister wanting to introduce a bill, informs the presiding of ficer. He/she\\nputs the question of introduction to the House. When approved, normally by voice-\\nvote, the Minister is called upon to introduce the bill.\\n(B) Second Reading: -This stage is the most vital stage. After general discussion the\\nHouse has four options: - (i) it may straightaway take the bill into detailed (clause-\\nby-clause) consideration or (ii) refer it to a select committee of the House or , (iii)\\nrefers it to the Joint Committee of both the Houses or (iv) circulate it among the\\npeople to elicit public opinion. If the bill is referred to a select committee of the\\nHouse or the joint select committee of both the Houses, the concerned committee\\nexamines the bill very minutely . Each and every clause is examined. The committee\\nmay also take the opinion of professionals and legal experts. After due deliberations,\\nthe committee submits its report to the House.\\n(C) Third Reading:- After the completion of the second reading, the Minister may move\\nthat the bill be passed. At this stage normally no discussion takes place. The members\\nmay oppose or support the adoption of the bill, by a simple majority of members\\npresent and voting.\\n2. Bill in the other House: -After the bill has been passed by one House, it goes to the\\nother House. Here also the same procedure of three readings is followed. The\\nfollowing consequences may follow: -\\n(A) It may pass it; then the bill is sent to the President for his assent.\\n(B) It may pass the bill with amendments. The bill will be sent back to the first House. In\\nsuch a case, the first House will consider the amendments and if it accepts the\\namendments then the bill will be sent to President for his assent. In case the first\\nHouse refuses to accept the amendments, then it means there is a deadlock.\\n(C) It may reject it. It means there is a deadlock. In order to remove the deadlock\\nbetween the two Houses, the President may call for a joint sitting of the two Houses.\\nSuch joint sittings are very rare in India and till now only three times such meetings\\nhave taken place. They were convened on the occasion of passage of Dowry\\nProhibition Bill 1959, Banking Service Commission (Repeal) Bill, 1978, and Prevention\\nof Terrorism Bill, 2002.\\n(D) President’ s assent to the Bill:- After being passed by both the Houses or the Joint\\nSitting of both Houses, the bill is referred to the President for his assent. The President\\nalso has some options in this regard: - (i) He may give his assent and with his assent,\\nthe bill becomes a law . (ii) He may withhold his assent, but may suggest some changes.\\nIn such a case the bill is sent back to the House from where it had originated. But if'),\n",

(iii) In 1986, the\\nPresident Giani Zail Singh invented a new option. He neither gave his assent nor he\\nreturned it to the Parliament for reconsideration of the Postal Bill. He sought some\\nclarifications, which were never provided. The bill thus, lapsed.\\n11.3.2 Money Bills\\nThe money bills are such bills which deal with money matters like imposition of taxes,\\ngovernmental expenditure and borrowings etc. In case there is a dispute as to weather a\\nbill is a money bill or not, the Speaker ’s decision is final. The money bill has to under go\\nthree readings like an ordinary bill but few considerations are also added here. They are\\n(I) Money bill can be introduced only in Lok Sabha and not in Rajya Sabha and that too\\nwith the prior approval of and on behalf of the President. (ii) After being passed by the\\nLok Sabha, the bill goes to the Rajya Sabha. Rajya Sabha has 14 days at its disposal for\\nconsideration and report. (iii) The Rajya Sabha cannot reject the money bill. It may either\\naccept it or make recommendations. (iv) In case Rajya Sabha chooses to make\\nrecommendations, the bill will return to Lok Sabha. The Lok Sabha may accept these\\nrecommendations or reject them. In any case the bill will not go back to Rajya Sabha.\\nInstead it will be sent directly to the President for his assent. (v) If the Rajya Sabha does\\nnot return the bill within 14 days, it will be deemed to have been passed by both the Houses\\nof the Parliament and sent to the President for his assent.\\nThe bill that deals with the money matters i.e. imposition, abolition, alteration of any\\ntax or the regulation of the borrowing of money or giving of any guarantee by the\\nGovernment of India or amendment of law with respect to any financial obligation\\nundertaken by the Government of India or related to Consolidated Fund or Contingency\\nFund of India, is called a Money Bill .\\n11.3.3 The Budget\\nThe Budget is an annual financial statement showing expected revenue and expenditure\\nof public money . It is not a bill. Every year the budget is presented by the Finance Minister\\nin the Lok Sabha. The budget – making is a big exercise. The Finance Ministry prepares\\nthe budget but it involves the entire government. The budget in India is presented in two\\nparts- Railway Budget and the General Budget.\\n(i) Presentation of the Budget: - The railway budget is generally presented by the Railway\\nminister in the third week of February , while the general budget is presented normally\\non the last working day of February . The general budget is presented along with the\\nspeech of the Finance Minister . The budget remains a closely guarded secret till its\\npresentation. After the speech, the Finance Minister introduces the Finance Bill, which\\ncontains the taxation proposals of the government. The House rises thereafter and\\nthere is no discussion on the day of the presentation of the Budget.\\nA new system of departmental select committees  has been introduced in India since\\n1993-94. The Lok Sabha sets up committees for all major Ministries and Departments of\\nUnion Government. The select committees consider demand for grants in details and\\nsubmit their recommendations to the Lok Sabha. After general discussion on the budget,\\nthe Houses are adjourned for about three weeks. During this period select committees of\\nDepartments of Ministry scrutinise budget demands and may make recommendations.'),\n",

What constitutes quorum in either House of Parliament?\\n11.4 Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha – A Comparative S tudy\\nYou have seen earlier that the two Houses of Parliament dif fer in their composition. From\\nthe federal point of view the Rajya Sabha represents the States in the Indian Union while\\nthe Lok Sabha is the representative of the Indian people. This is also the reason why the\\nmethod of election dif fers. The members of Legislative Assemblies of the S tates elect the\\nmembers of Rajya Sabha while the people directly participate in the elections to the Lok\\nSabha. Rajya Sabha is a permanent House while the Lok Sabha is constituted for a specified\\nterm of five years. From the constitutional point of view , the relationship between the two\\nHouses can best be studied from three angles which are as follows: -\\n1. There are certain powers and functions in which Lok Sabha is superior to the Rajya\\nSabha. Introduction and adoption of money bills and removal of a cabinet by passing\\nno confidence motion are two examples relevant here.\\n2. In certain areas Rajya Sabha has been vested with exclusive powers. It does not\\nshare these powers with the Lok Sabha. For example, it can declare a subject in\\nstate as a matter of national importance and facilitate a central legislation.\\n3. In several areas, both the Houses enjoy equal powers. The examples are adoption of\\nbills other than money bills, approval of proclamation of emer gency , moving of\\nadjournment and other types of motions.\\nMembers of both houses of Parliament get Rs. 2 Crore per annum from the Members of\\nParliament Local Development Fund. This fund is not directly allotted to the MP but to the\\nrespective district headquarters and the MP can use it for development projects in his\\narea.'),\n",

It\\nhas two Houses-Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha and the President is an integral part of the\\nParliament. Rajya Sabha is a permanent body , which can never be dissolved. Each member\\nof Rajya Sabha enjoys a term of six years and one-third of its member retire after every\\ntwo years.The Rajya Sabha represents the States in Indian Union. In contrast, the Lok\\nSabha or the lower House has a fixed term of five years and the President before the\\nexpiry of stipulated five years can also dissolve it. Members of the Lok Sabha are directly\\nelected by people on the basis of universal adult franchise. While the Vice-President\\nchairs the meetings of Rajya Sabha, the Lok Sabha is presided over by the Speaker . You\\nhave read about the powers of the Speaker . You have read that the quorum of both the\\nHouses is one-tenth of the total membership. Without the quorum, no meeting of the\\nHouse/Houses can take place. You have also read in details about the various legislative,\\nexecutive, financial, electoral, judicial and miscellaneous functions of the Parliament, and\\nits law making procedure. Finally , you have been able to compare the two Houses and find\\nthat Lok Sabha is more powerful than Rajya Sabha.\\nTerminal Exer cises\\n1.

A single judiciary represents a hierarchy of courts. The Supreme Court\\nstands at the top of this single integrated judicial system with High Courts at the State\\nlevel. Below the High Courts, there are several subordinate courts such as the District\\nCourts which deal with civil cases and the Session Courts which decide criminal cases.\\nINDIAN JUDICIAL SYSTEM\\nSUPREME COURT OF INDIA \\nSTATE HIGH COURTS \\nSUBORDINATE COURTS OR LOWER COURTS \\n12.2 The Supreme Court\\nThe Supreme Court is the highest judicial authority of India. It consists of the Chief Justice\\nand 25 other judges. The Parliament may increase the number of judges if it deems\\nnecessary . To begin with, besides the Chief Justice, there were only 7 other judges. The\\nParliament has increased the number of judges from time to time. As in 2005, there are 25\\njudges besides the Chief Justice who is also called the Chief Justice of India.\\nThe Chief Justice and other judges of the Supreme Court are appointed by the President\\nof India. While appointing the Chief Justice, the President is constitutionally required to\\nconsult such other judges of the Supreme Court as he deems proper , but outgoing Chief\\nJustice is always consulted. Normally , the senior most judge of the Supreme Court is\\nappointed as the Chief Justice of India, although there is no constitutional requirement to\\ndo so. While appointing other judges, the President is bound to consult the Chief Justice\\nand other senior judges, if he deems proper .\\nWhenever there is vacancy or a likely vacancy in the Supreme Court, the Chief Justice\\nand four other senior most judges consider various names and recommend the names of\\nthe persons to be appointed as judges of the Supreme Court. This system is based on a\\nruling of the Constitutional Bench of a Supreme Court (handed down in 1993 and reinforced\\nin 1999). Thus, while the Constitution still provides that the President is the appointing\\nauthority of the Supreme Court judges, the ruling of the Supreme Court, has since 1999,\\nbecome virtually binding on the President. The power of selection of judges has passed on\\nto a group of Supreme Court judges, called the Collegium of the Court. The President now'),\n",

A judge may voluntarily resign before expiry of his term. In exeptional\\ncases a Supreme Court judge may be removed before the age of retirement, according to\\nthe procedure laid down in the Constitution. Thus a judge of the Supreme Court can be\\nremoved from office by an order of the President passed after an address by each House\\nof the Parliament supported by a majority of total membership of the House and not less\\nthan two-third majority of the members of the House present and voting, passed in the\\nsame session, has been presented to the President for such removal on the ground of\\nproved misbehavior or capacity . So far , proceedings for removal were initiated only in one\\ncase against a judge of the Supreme Court. But he/she could not be removed because the\\nresolution could not be passed by the Parliament. It is clear that Supreme Court judges\\nenjoy security of tenure, and the executive cannot arbitrarily remove them.\\nNo person who has held office of a judge of the Supreme Court is allowed to plead as an\\nadvocate in any court or before any authority within the territory of India.\\nThe judges of the Supreme Court are paid such salaries as are determined by the Parliament\\nfrom time to time.\\n12.2.2 A Cour t of Record\\nThe Supreme Court is a Court of Record. It has two implications. All its decisions and\\njudgments are cited as precedents in all courts of the country . They have the force of law\\nand are binding on all lower Courts, and indeed the High Courts.

(educationist / jurist / politician)\\n12.3 Jurisdiction of The Supreme Court\\nThe scope of powers of Supreme Court to hear and decide cases is called its jurisdiction.\\nThe Supreme Court has three types of jurisdictions namely original, appellate and advisory .\\nLet us now examine the three jurisdictions.\\n12.3.1 Original Jurisdiction\\nThere are certain cases which fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.\\nIt means that all such cases begin or originate in the Supreme Court, only . It also means\\nthat such cases cannot be initiated in any other court. The cases or disputes that come\\nunder the original jurisdiction are given below:\\n(i) (a)Disputes between the Government of India on the one side and one or more\\nStates on the other side.\\n(b)Disputes between the Government of India and one or more States on one side\\nand one or more States on the other side.\\n(c)Disputes between two or more States.\\n(ii) The Supreme Court has been invested with special powers in the enforcement of\\nFundamental Rights. In this connection, it has the power to issue directions or writs.\\n(iii) Cases under Public Interests Litigation (PIL) can also be heard directly . (This is an\\nextra Constituional practice; there is no mention of PIL in the Constitution).\\n12.3.2 Appellate Jurisdiction\\nThe power of a superior/higher court to hear and decide appeals against the judgment of\\na lower court is called appellate jurisdiction. The Supreme Court has vast appellate\\njurisdiction. It hears appeals against the judgment of the High Courts. Thus, it is the highest\\nand the final Court of Appeal. If one of the parties to a dispute is not satisfied with the\\ndecision of the High Court, one can go to the Supreme Court and file an appeal. The\\nappeals can be filled in Civil, Criminal and Constitutional cases.\\n(i) Appeals in Civil Cases\\nDisputes relating to property , marriage, money , contract and service etc are called civil\\ncases. If a civil case involves a substantial point of law of public importance needing\\ninterpretatation of the Constitution or law , an appeal against the High Court decision can\\nbe made to Supreme Court. Earlier the financial limit of such civil cases was Rs. 20,000/\\n- but now according to the 30th Amendment of 1972, there is no minimum amount for\\ntaking a civil appeal to the Supreme Court. If substantial question of interpretation of law\\nor Constitution is involved, appeal may be made against the decision of the High Court.\\n(ii) Appeals in Criminal Cases\\nAn appeal may be brought to the Supreme Court against a High Court decision in a'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Hp\\\\Documents\\\\vscode\\\\prepbridge\\\\prepbridge\\\\data\\\\indian-polity.pdf', 'page': 133}, page_content='MODULE - 3\\nNotes\\n132Political Science\\nStructur e of Government criminal case in a number of situations. Firstly , if a High Court sets aside an appeal or an\\norder of acquittal passed by a lower court and awards death sentence to the accused, he\\nmay bring an appeal to the Supreme Court by right.\\nSecondly , appeal can also be made to the Supreme Court if the High Court withdraws a\\ncase from a lower court to itself, declares the accused guilty and awards death sentence.\\nIn this situation also appeals can be made as a matter of right and without certificate from\\nthe High Court.\\nThe appeal in cases other than these two categories may also be brought to the Supreme\\nCourt provided the High Court grants a certificate that the case is fit for appeal to the\\nSupreme Court.\\nIn case where the High Court refuses to certify a case to be fit for appeal to the Supreme\\nCourt, one may seek special leave to appeal from the Supreme Court itself. The Supreme\\nCourt may grant such a special leave in its discretion but only in rare cases.\\n(iii) Appeals in Constitutional Cases\\nA constitutional case is neither a civil dispute, nor concerning a crime. It is a case arising\\nout of different interpretations of Constitution, mainly regarding the fundamental rights. In\\nsuch Constitutional Cases an appeal can be taken to the Supreme Court only if a High\\nCourt certifies that the matter in dispute involves a substantial question of law .\\nIf the High Court denies a certificate of fitness to appeal to the Supreme Court, the\\nSupreme Court can use its discretion and grant special leave to appeal to itself in any case\\nit deems fit.\\n12.3.3 Advisor y Jurisdiction\\nThis power implies Court’ s right to give advice, if sought. Under advisory jurisdiction, the\\nPresident of India may refer any question of law or public importance to Supreme Court\\nfor its advice. But the Supreme Court is not bound to give advice. In case, the advice or\\nthe opinion of the Court is sent to the President, he may or may not accept it. The advice\\nof the Court is not binding on the President. So far , whenever the Court has given its\\nadvice, the President has always accepted it. The Court refused to give its advice on the\\nquestion whether a temple existed at the spot, where Babri Masjid was built at Ayodhya.\\n12.4 Guardian of The Constitution\\nThe Constitution of India is the supreme law of the land and the Supreme Court is its\\ninterpreter and guardian. It does not allow the executive or the Parliament to violate any\\nprovision of the Constitution. It can also review any action of the Government, which\\nallegdly violates any provision of the Fundamental Rights. This power of the Supreme\\nCourt is called Judicial Review about which we shall study later . If it finds violation of any\\nprovision of the Constitution, it may declare the concerned law as ultra-vires , or null and\\nvoid. It is on the basis of this power of Judicial Review of the Supreme Court that it is\\ncalled guardian of the Constitution. It is also called ‘a champion of liberties’ and ‘a watchdog\\nof democracy’.\\nIn this context the role and the functions of the Supreme Court are wide and comprehensive.'),\n",

These are in the nature of the writs  of\\nHabeas Corpus, Mandamus , Prohibition,  Certiorari  and Quo Warranto . These writs\\nmake the Supreme Court a protector and guarantor of fundamental rights. The idea is that\\nin case of violation of a law or right, the Court may issue directions for compliance with\\nthe Constitution. Thus, the citizens of India are secure as far as fundamental rights are\\nconcerned.\\nThe Supreme Court has the right to declare a law passed by the legislature null and void if\\nit encroaches upon our fundamental rights. It has rejected many legislations, which violated\\nfundamental rights. This shows how the Supreme Court has always served as the guardian\\nof fundamental rights.\\nWrit:  It is an order issued to a lower Court or a functionary of the State to take steps\\nto restore rights of the people.\\n12.4.2 Review of Its Own Judgment\\nIf the Supreme Court discovers that there are some new facts or evidences or if it is\\nsatisfied that some mistake or error took place in its previous decision, it has the power to\\nreview the case and alter its previous decisions. This is generally done when a review\\npetition is filed.

Our High\\nCourts also exercise this power .\\nJudicial Review does not mean that every law passed by the legislature is taken up by the\\nSupreme Court for review .

Therefore, relief may not be granted.\\nIn a democratic country like India the power of Judicial Review is an important guarantee\\nof the rights of the people. Besides, the Supreme Court has been interpreting various\\nprovisions of the Constitution. Its rulings are treated as law of the land.\\nLet us now see how the Supreme Court has played its role as a custodian of the civil\\nliberties and in particular of the fundamental rights.\\nThe Right to Equality is an important right, which ensures equality before law . The Right\\nto Equality also means absence of special privileges and inequality of treatment. So, the\\nSupreme Court in the name of Protective Discrimination has justified the benefits or\\nconcessions in the form of reservations or relaxation of eligibility conditions.\\nThe Right to Freedom has given various kinds of freedoms to all of us. But the freedom of\\npress was not mentioned in the Constitution. It was decided by the Supreme Court that\\nfreedom of press as a right is implied in right to freedom of expression. Thus, the Court\\nexpanded the right to freedom.\\nThe Supreme Court has regarded the Right to Know as an important right to be able to\\ntake part in the participatory process of development and democracy . The Court had ruled\\nthat the Right to life in, Artile 21 implies and includes the right to education and clean\\nenvironment also.\\nRegarding the delay in deciding the cases, the Supreme Court has held that delay in trial\\nconstitutes denial of justice. It has also laid down that speedy trial, release on bail of under\\ntrials, free legal aid to the poor and accused are also the fundamental rights.\\nThe Supreme Court has used its power of judicial review and given various historic decisions\\nto safeguard the rights of the individuals. It has stood guard of linguistic rights of minorities,\\nreligious rights of the people, welfare of the workers and daily wage earners.\\nIf has also taken action to protect bonded labour , prevent exploitation of women, children\\nand deprived sections of society .\\nNo doubt, the Supreme Court through its power of judicial review has guarded our rights\\nin various walks of life. The Supreme Court has given momentous decisions. Through,\\nwhat is called “judicial activism”, the Court has given such rulings as compulsory use of\\nCNG fuel for the use of public transport vehicles in Delhi so that pollution could be brought\\nunder control. Similarly , for the protection of lives of people, it has made the use of helmets\\ncompulsory for two-wheeler users, and even the pillion riders.\\nThe power of judicial review is an important guarantee of the rights of the people. It does\\nnot allow any violation of the Constitution. It has given several new interpretations to the\\nConstitutional provisions.

It is the privilege of\\nthe Court to entertain the application for public interest litigation (PIL). The concept of\\nPIL was introduced by Justice P .N.

The Supreme Court on the basis of letters received from journalists, lawyers\\nand social workers and even on the basis of newspaper reports has taken up a number of\\nmatters of public interest. Let us take some examples to know how PIL has helped the\\npeople to get justice.\\nUnder PIL, the rights of under trials held under illegal detention have been restored. The\\nSupreme Court ordered the release of many detenues without trial on the ground of their\\npersonal liberty , which could not be curbed due to judicial or bureaucratic inef ficiency .\\nThe Supreme Court has also taken up steps to free bonded labourers, tribals, slum dwellers,\\nwomen in rescue homes, children in juvenile homes, child labour etc.\\nIn case of environmental pollution, the Supreme Court has ordered closure of a few factories\\nnear Kanpur , Delhi and other places.\\nWith more and more decisions coming from the Supreme Court, the scope of PIL  has\\nwidened. Now a person can approach the Court through a letter and if the Supreme Court\\nbelieves that the matter is of public interest, it can consider the letter to be a petition and\\ndirect the hearing of the matter so that public interest may be protected.

In a parliamentary system, as you know , the Council of\\nMinisters is responsible to the legislature and therefore, the real powers are exercised by\\nit and not the Governor . He/she, like the President, has to act according to the advice of\\nthe Council of Ministers, headed by the Chief Minister . Hence, the Governor ordinarily\\nhas to act as a constitutional or ceremonial head.\\nHowever , under extraordinary situations, the Governor gets an opportunity to exercise his/\\nher authority according to his/her discretion. Since the 1967 General Elections, when several\\nStates opted for Samyukta Vidhayak Dal (SVD) governments, due to the discretionary\\npowers, the office of the Governor has become quite controversial. The Governors have\\nacted according to their whims and on certain occasions have tried to please the ruling\\nparty at the National Government level. According to the constitutional experts, the\\nGovernor ’s role in three respects i.e. recommending to the President for the proclamation\\nof emergency; appointing a Chief Minister in case no party gets a clear majority and\\ndeciding the fate of the Chief Minister in case of intra-party defections, has become very\\ncontroversial. The deterioration in the political standards and practices that has come\\nabout in the wake of multi-party ministries in many of the States, party rivalries, political\\ndefections and fragmentation of the political parties has been at the root of these\\ncontroversies. Suggestions and recommendations of the Administrative Reforms\\nCommission as well as of Sarkaria Commission have remained only on paper , in spite of\\nthe fact that these recommendations would help in minimising partiality on the part of the\\nfunctioning of the Governors.\\n13.2 The Chief Minister\\nEach State has a Council of Ministers to aid and advise the Governor in the exercise of his\\nfunctions. Chief Minister is the head of the government in the State. The Council of\\nMinisters with the Chief Minister as its head exercises real authority at the State level.\\n13.2.1 Formation of the Council of Ministers\\nThe Chief Minister is appointed by the Governor . The person who commands the\\nmajority support in the S tate Legislative Assembly (V idhan Sabha) is appointed as\\nthe Chief Minister by the Governor . The other Ministers are appointed by the Governor\\non the advice of the Chief Minister . The ministers included in the Council of Minister ’s\\nmust belong to either House of the S tate legislature. A person who is not a member of\\nthe S tate legislature may be appointed a minister , but he/she ceases to hold of fice if\\nhe/she is not elected to the State legislature within six months of his appointment.\\nThe portfolios to the members of the Council of Ministers are allocated by the Governor\\non the advice of the Chief Minister .'),\n",

The constitutional\\nposition of the Chief Minister is more or less similar to that of the Prime Minister . The\\nChief Minister plays an important role in the administration of the S tate. We can discuss\\nhis functions as follows:\\n1.Chief Minister is the real head of the State Government. Ministers are appointed by\\nthe Governor on the advice of the Chief Minister . The Governor allocates portfolios\\nto the ministers on the advice of the Chief Minister .\\n2.Chief Minister presides over the Cabinet meetings. He/she coordinates the functioning\\nof different ministries. He/she guides the functioning of the Cabinet.\\n3.Chief Minister plays a key role in framing the laws and policies of the State\\nGovernment. Bills are introduced by the ministers in the State legislature with his/her\\napproval. He/she is the chief spokesman of the policies of his government both inside\\nand outside the State Legislature.\\n4.The Constitution provides that the Chief Minister shall communicate to the Governor\\nall decisions of the Council of Ministers relating to the administration and the affairs\\nof the State and proposals for legislation.\\n5.The Chief Minister furnishes such information relating to the administration of the\\naffairs of the S tate and proposals for legislation as the Governor may call for .\\n6.If the Governor so requires, the Chief Minister submits for consideration of the Council\\nof Ministers any matter on which a decision has been taken by a minister but which\\nhas not been considered by the Cabinet.\\n7.The Chief Minister is the sole link of communication between the Cabinet and the\\nGovernor . The Governor has the right to be informed by the Chief Minister about the\\ndecisions taken by the Council of Ministers.\\nThe above functions show that the real authority is vested with the Council of Ministers\\nheaded by the Chief Minister . The Council of Ministers is the real executive in the S tate.\\nThe position of the State Council of Ministers largely depends upon the strength of the\\nruling party in the S tate Assembly and the personality of the Chief Minister . The position\\nof the Chief Minister is more powerful when his party is in power in the Centre as well. As\\nlong as the Chief Minister and his Council of Ministers enjoy the confidence of majority in\\nthe Legislative Assembly , he exercises the real executive power in the S tate.\\n13.3 Relationship of the Governor with the Chief Minister\\nThe Governor is the constitutional head of the S tate. All executive actions in the S tate are\\ntaken in his name. The Governor appoints the Chief Minister and on the advice of the\\nChief Minister he appoints other ministers. The Governor is responsible for smooth running\\nof the State administration. It is his/her duty to see that the State administration is carried\\non in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. If he/she finds that the constitutional\\nmachinery of the State has broken down or the administration cannot be carried on in\\naccordance with the provisions of the Constitution, he/she may recommend to the Union\\nGovernment to proclaim emergency in the State. The Governor in his/her report can advise'),\n",

If the President is satisfied, he/she\\nwill declare emer gency under Article 356, popularly known as President’ s Rule in the\\nState. After proclamation, the S tate comes under the control of the Centre and the Governor\\nacts as the Centre’ s agent. The Council of Ministers is dismissed and Assembly (V idhan\\nSabha) is dissolved or suspended.\\nThe Constitution provides that there shall be a Council of Ministers with the Chief Minister\\nas its head to aid and advise the Governor in the exercise of his functions, except when he/\\nshe is required by the Constitution to act on his discretion. When the Chief Minister enjoys\\nthe confidence of the majority in the S tate legislature, then the Governor ’s capacity to\\nexercise his/her discretionary powers is reduced. In such a situation the Chief Minister is\\nthe real head of the State administration and the Governor is the constitutional head. So\\nwe see that the Governor plays a dual role. As the constitutional head of the S tate, he/she\\nacts on the advice of the Council of Ministers and also serves as the agent of the Central\\nGovernment. The relations between the Governor and the Chief Minister are influenced\\nby the political and constitutional conditions in the State. In normal conditions, the Governor\\nis the ceremonial head of the S tate but during the President’ s Rule he/she becomes the\\nagent of the Centre and assumes control of the State administration. Keeping the spirit of\\nthe Constitution in mind, the Governor may in a sense be the “eyes and ears” of the\\nCentral Government and as he/she is appointed, removed or transferred by the Centre he\\ncontinues to be subservient to Centre as well as the party in power there. It may he\\nemphasised that the job of the Governor would not be merely that of an umpire to see that\\nthe game is played according to the letter and spirit of the Constitutional provisions.\\nIntext Questions 13.2\\n1.

At present\\nthere are 28 S tates in the Indian Union and each one of them has a Legislature. You have\\nalready read in lesson no.1 1 about the Parliament of India, which is the law making body\\nat the Union level. The State Legislature is a law making body at state level.

This means that these S tate have unicameral Legislature. In a few S tates,\\nthere are two Houses of the Legislature namely , Legislative Assembly (V idhan Sabha)\\nand Legislative council (V idhan Parishad) besides the Governor .Where there are two\\nHouses, the Legislature, is known as bicameral.\\nFive S tates have the bicameral, legislature. The Lagislative Assembly is known as lower\\nHouse or popular House. The Legislative Council is known as upper House.

It represents the people of\\nState. The members of Vidhan Sabha are directly elected by people on the basis of universal\\nadult franchise. They are directly elected by all adult citizens registered as voters in the\\nState. All men and women who are 18 years of age and above are eligible to be included\\nin the voters’  List. They vote to elect members of S tate Assembly . Members are elected\\nfrom territorial constituencies. Every State is divided into as many (single member)\\nconstituencies as the number of members to be elected. As in case of Lok Sabha, certain\\nnumber of seats are reserved for Scheduled Castes, and in some States for Scheduled\\nTribes also. This depends on population of these weaker sections in the S tate.\\nIn order to become a Member of Vidhan Sabha a person must:\\nbe a citizen of India;\\nhave attained the age of 25 years;\\nhis/her name must be in voters’ list;\\nmust not hold any office of profit i.e.;\\nshould not be a government servant.\\nThe number of Vidhan Sabha members cannot be more than 500 and not less than 60.\\nHowever , very small S tates have been allowed to have lesser number of members. Thus\\nGoa has only 40 members in its Assembly . Uttar Pradesh (is a big state even after creation\\nof Uttaranchal from this state in 2002) has 403 seats in the Assembly .\\nThe Governor of the S tate has the power to nominate one member of Anglo-Indian\\ncommunity if this community is not adequately represented in the House. As in case of the\\nLok Sabha, some seats are reserved for the members of Scheduled Castes and Schedule\\nTribes. The tenure of Vidhan Sabha is five years, but the Governor can dissolve it before\\nthe completion of its term on the advice of Chief Minister . It may be dissolved by the\\nPresident in case of constitutional emer gency proclaimed under Article 356 of the\\nConstitution.\\nIn case of proclamation of national emer gency (under Article 352) the Parliament can\\nextend the term of the Legislative Assemblies for a period not exceeding one year at a\\ntime.\\n14.1.2 Presiding Officer (The Speaker)\\nThe members of Vidhan Sabha elect their presiding of ficer. The Presiding of ficer is known\\nas the Speaker . The Speaker presides over the meatings of the House and conducts its\\nproceedings. He maintains order in the House, allows the members to ask questions and\\nspeak. He puts bills and other measures to vote and announces the result of voting. The\\nSpeaker does not ordinarily vote at the time of voting. However , he may exercise casting\\nvote in case of a tie. The Deputy Speaker presides over the meeting during the absence of\\nthe Speaker . He is also elected by the Assembly from amongst its members.\\nA tie means that equal numbers of members have voted in favour and against a bill\\nor resolution. To break the tie, casting vote is exercised by the presiding of ficer of\\nthe Legislative Assembly .'),\n",

It is not in existence in very\\nState. Very few S tates have bicameral Legislature that means having two Houses. At\\npresent five states viz. Utter Pradesh, Bihar , Karnataka, Maharashtra and Jammu &\\nKashmir have Vidhan Parishad while, remaining 23 S tates have one House, i.e. Vidhan\\nSabha. Legislative Councils are legacy of the British period. The Parliament can create\\nVidhan Parishad in a S tate where it does not exist, if the Legislative Assembly of the S tate\\npasses a resolution to this ef fect by a majority of the total membership of the Assembly\\nand by a majority of not less than two thirds of the members of the Assembly present and\\nvoting, and sends the resolution to the Parliament. Similarly , if a S tate has a Council and\\nthe Assembly wants it to be abolished, it may adopt a resolution by similar majority and\\nsend it to Parliament. In this situation Parliament resolves to abolish the concerned\\nLegislative Council. Accordingly , Councils of Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and\\nWest Bengal were abolished.\\nAccording to the Constitution, the total number of members in the Vidhan Parishad of a\\nState should not exceed one-third of the total number of members of Vidhan Sabha but\\nthis number should not be less than 40. The Jammu & Kashmir is an exception where\\nVidhan Parishad has 36 members.\\nIn order to be a member of the Legislative Council the person concerned should\\n–be a citizen of India:\\n–have attained the age of 30 years;\\n–be a registered voter in the State;\\n–not hold any office of profit.\\nThe Vidhan Parishad is partly elected and partly nominated. Most of the members are\\nindirectly elected in accordance with the principle of proportional representation by means\\nof single transferable vote system. Different categories of members represent different\\ninterests. The composition of the Legislative Council is as follows:\\ni.One-third members of the Council are elected by the members of the Vidhan Sabha.'),\n",

(Punjab, Haryana, Uttar\\nPradesh)\\n14.2 Powers and Functions of The S tate Legislatur e\\n14.2.1 Law Making Function\\nThe primary function of the State Legislature, like the Union Parliament, is law-making.\\nThe State Legislature is empowered to make laws on State List and Concurrent List. The\\nParliament and the Legislative Assemblies have the right to make the laws on the subjects\\nmentioned in the Concurrent List. But in case of contradiction between the Union and\\nState law on the subject the law made by the Parliament shall prevail.\\nBills are of two types-Ordinary bills and Money bills. Ordinary bills can be introduced in\\neither of the Houses (if the State Legislature is bicameral), but Money bill is first introduced\\nin the Vidhan Sabha. After the bill is passed by both Houses, it is sent to the Governor for\\nhis assent. The Governor can send back the bill for reconsideration. When this bill is\\npassed again by the Legislature, the Governor has to give his assent. You have read when\\nthe Parliament is not in session and if there is a necessity of certain law , the President\\nissues Ordinance. Similarly , the Governor can issue an Ordinance on the S tate subjects\\nwhen legislature is not in session. The Ordinances have the force of law . The Ordinances\\nissued are laid before the State Legislature when it reassembles. It ceases to be in operation\\nafter the expirty of six weeks, unless rejected by the Legislature earlier .\\nThe Legislature passes a regular bill, to become a law , to replace the ordinance. This is\\nusually done within six weeks after reassembly of Legislature.\\n14.2.2 Financial Powers\\nThe S tate Legislature keeps control over the finances of the S tate. A money bill is introduced\\nfirst only in the Vidhan Sabha. The money bill includes authorisation of the expenditure to\\nbe incurred by the government, imposition or abolition of taxes, borrowing, etc. The bill is\\nintroduced by a Minister on the recommendations of the Governor . The money bill cannot\\nbe introduced by a private member . The Speaker of the Vidhan Sabha certifies that a\\nparticular bill is a money bill.\\nAfter a money bill is passed by the Vidhan Sabha, it is sent to the Vidhan Parishad. It has\\nto return this bill within 14 days with, or without, its recommendations. The Vidhan Sabha\\nmay either accept or reject its recommendations. The bill is deemed to have been passed\\nby both Houses. After this stage, the bill is sent to the Governor for his assent. The\\nGovernor cannot withhold his assent, as money bills are introduced with his prior approval.\\n14.2.3 Control over the Executive\\nLike the Union Legislature, the State Legislature keeps control over the executive. The\\nCouncil of Ministers is responsible to Vidhan Sabha collectively and remains in the of fice\\nso long as it enjoys the confidence of the Vidhan Sabha. The Council is removed if the\\nVidhan Sabha adopts a vote of no-confidence, or when it rejects a government bill.\\nIn addition to the no-confidence motion, the Legislature keeps checks on the government'),\n",

Thus they have say in the election of the President of\\nthe Republic (see Lesson No. 10) The members of the Vidhan Sabha also elect members\\nof the Rajya Sabha from their respective S tates. One-third members of the Vidhan Parishad\\n(if it is in existence in the S tate) are also elected by the members of the Vidhan Sabha.\\nIn all these elections, members of the Vidhan Sabha (Assembly) cost their votes in\\naccordance with single transferable vote system.\\n14.2.5 Constitutional Functions\\nYou have learnt about the procedure of amendment of the Constitution. An Amendment\\nrequires special majority of each House of the Parliament and ratification by not less than\\nhalf of the States relating to Federal subjects. The resolution for the ratification is passed\\nby State Legislatures with simple majority .

It is compulsory in case the powers of\\nthe High Court are being curtailed. In some other cases, prior approval of the President\\nfor introducing the bill in the Legislature is essential such as, for imposition of restriction on\\nthe freedom of trade and commerce within the State or with other States.\\nThe Parliament has the complete control on the entire State List at the time when the\\nnational emer gency has been declared (under Art. 352), although the S tate Legislature\\nremains in existence and continues to perform its functions. In case of breakdown of\\nconstitutional machinery (under Art. 356) after fall of popular Government in the S tate, the\\nPresident’ s rule is imposed. The Parliament then acquires the power to make laws for that\\nState, for the period of constitutional emer gency .\\nThe Parliament can also make laws on a subject of the State list in order to carry on its\\ninternational responsibility . If the Rajya Sabha adopts a resolution by two-thirds majority to\\nthis effect, on its own or at the request of two or more States, the Parliament can enact\\nlaws on a specified subject of the State list.\\nFundamental rights also impose limitations on the powers of the State Legislature. It cannot\\nmake laws which violate the rights of the people. Any law passed by the S tate Legislature\\ncan be declared void by the High Court or Supreme Court if it is found unconstitutional as\\nviolate of the fundamental rights.\\n14.4 Comparison of the two Houses of the S tate Legislatur e\\nLegislative Assembly (V idhan Sabha) like the Lok Sabha, occupies a dominant position.\\nLegislative Council (V idhan Parishad) enjoys much less powers as compared to the powers\\nof Vidhan Sabha even in relation to ordinary bills. The Rajya Sabha at the Centre enjoys\\nequal powers in consideration of bills other than money bills; but Vidhan Parishad enjoys\\nmuch lesser powers as compared to the Rajya Sabha.\\nThe relative position of the Vidhan Sabha and Vidhan Parishad is as under:\\n14.4.1 In Relation to Ordinary Bills\\nIn case of the Parliament, if there is disagreement between the two Houses over an\\nordinary bill, the President summons a joint sitting of both the Houses and if the bill is\\npassed there by the majority of votes, the bill is taken as passed by both Houses of the\\nParliament. But this provision of the joint sitting does not exist in the States.\\nAlthough an ordinary bill can originate in either House of the State Legislature, yet both\\nHouses have unequal powers. If a bill is passed in the Vidhan Sabha, it is transmitted to the\\nVidhan Parishad for consideration. When it is passed by Vidhan Parishad without any\\namendment, the bill is sent to the Governor for his assent. In case, the bill is (a) rejected by\\nthe Parishad or (b) more than thr ee months  elapsed without the bill being passed by the\\nParishad, or (c) bill is passed with amendment to which the Vidhan Sabha does not agree,\\nthe Vidhan Sabha may pass the bill again in the same or in the subsequent session. After\\nthat the bill is again sent to the Vidhan Parishad. If the Vidhan Parishad does not return the\\nbill within a period of one month, the bill is deemed to have been passed by both Houses of\\nthe S tate Legislature and is sent to Governor for his assent. Thus the Vidhan Parishad can\\ndelay the bill for a maximum period of four months . On the other hand, if the bill is first\\npassed by the Vidhan Parishad and rejected by the Vidhan Sabha, the bill is rejected and\\ncannot become a law .'),\n",

It cannot be initiated\\nin the Vidhan Parishad. The Speaker of the Vidhan Sabha certifies whether a particular\\nbill is a money bill. After the bill is passed in the Vidhan Sabha, it is sent to the Vidhan\\nParishad. The Vidhan Parishad gets 14 days time to consider the bill. If the Parishad\\npasses the bill, it is sent to the Governor for his assent. If the bill is not returned by the\\nVidhan Parishad within 14 days, it is deemed to have been passed by the Vidhan Parishad.\\nIf it suggests certain changes in the bill and sends to Vidhan Sabha, the Vidhan Sabha may\\naccept or reject the changes suggested by the Parishad. The bill is then sent to the Governor\\nfor his assent who is bound to give his assent.\\n14.4.3 Control Over the Executive\\nThe Council of Ministers of the S tate is responsible to the Vidhan Sabha only and remains\\nin the of fice so long as it enjoys the confidenc of the Assembly (V idhan Sabha). Although\\nmembers in the Vidhan Parishad can ask questions, introduce adjournment motions, calling\\nattention notives, etc. yet the Vidhan Parishad cannot remove the government.\\n14.4.4 Electoral Functions\\nOnly the elected members of the Vidhan Sabha are entitled to participate in the election of\\nthe President of India. The members of the Vidhan Sabha do so in their capacity as the\\nmembers of the Electoral College. But the members of the Vidhan Parishad are not entitled\\nto vote in the election of the President. Members of the Rajya Sabha from each State are\\nelected only by the members of Assembly and not of the Council.\\nThe above discussion makes it clear that the Vidhan Parishad is powerless and non-\\ninfluential House. It has become a secondary House. Thus many States prefer to have\\nunicameral Legislature. But the Vidhan Parishad is not superflous. It serves as a check on\\nhasty Legislation made by Vidhan Sabha by highlighting the short bills comings or defects\\nof the bill. It lessens the burden of the Vidhan Sabha, as some bill are initiated in the\\nVidhan Parishad.\\nWhat You Have Learnt\\nThe S tate Legislature consists of the Governor , the Legislative Council (V idhan Parishad)\\nand the Legislative Assembly (V idhan Sabha). In most of the S tates there are unicameral\\nLegislatures. These S tate Legislatures consist of the Governor and the Legislative Assembly .\\nThe Parliament is empowered to set up or abolish the Vidhan Parishad in a S tate. The\\nVidhan Parishad is partly indirectly elected and partly nominated. It is permanent House\\nlike the Rajya Sabha. It is never dissolved. The tenure of its members is six year . One third\\nmembers retire after every two years.\\nThe minimum age for the membership of the Vidhan Parishad is 30 years, it is 25 years for\\nVidhan Sabha. Member of the Vidhan Sabha are directly elected by the people of the\\nState on the basis of universal adult franchise. Its tenure is five years, but the Governor\\ncan dissolve it earlier on the advice of the Chief Minister . In case of constitutional breakdown\\nit may be dissolved by the President. The powers of the State Legislture are law-making,\\ncontrol over the finances, and the executive, electoral functions and constitutional functions.'),\n",

The High Courts are part of the Indian judiciary , and function under the supervision,\\nguidance and control of the Supreme Court. As highest court in the S tate, a High Court\\nsupervises the subordinate courts in the State. The High Courts are mainly courts of\\nappeal. These Courts hear appeals from numerous subordinate courts working at district\\nlevel. The system of appointment of judges, their qualifications and the working of\\nsubordinate courts is under the direct control and supervision of the High Court of the\\nState concerned.

For example, the S tates of Punjab and Haryana  and the Union Territory\\nof Chandigarh have a common High Court situated at Chandigarh. Similarly , the High\\nCourt of Guwahati is common for seven northeastern S tates of Assam, Nagaland, Manipur ,\\nMeghalaya, Mizoram, Tripura and Arunachal Pradesh. Delhi, though not a S tate, has its\\nown separate High Court. Every High Court has a Chief Justice and a number of judges.\\nThe number of judges varies from State to State. The number of judges of each High\\nCourt is determined by the President.\\nThe judges of the High Courts are appointed by the President of India. While appointing\\nChief Justice of a High Court, the President has to consult the Chief Justice of the Supreme\\nCourt and the Governor of the State concerned. While appointing other judges, the President\\nconsults the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, the Chief Justice of the High Court and\\nGovernor of the State concerned. The judges can be transferred from one High Court to\\nanother by the President. As mentioned earlier , consultation with the Chief Justice of the\\nSupreme Court in respect of appointments and transfers of the judges of the High Court is\\nalso obligatory and binding for the President. While the constitutional status of the President\\nremains intact, the actual selection of judges is made by a team of senior judges of the\\nSupreme Court, headed by the Chief Justice of India in accordance with 1993 ruling as\\nreinterpreted in 1999 by the Supreme Court.This is known as Collegium of the Supreme\\nCourt. Its recommendations are binding on the President.\\n15.1.2 Qualifications, Tenur e and Removal of the Judges\\nIn order to be appointed as a judge of a High Court, the person concerned should possess\\nfollowing  qualifications:\\n(i)He or she should be a citizen of India.\\n(ii)He or she should have held a judicial office, at the district level or below for at least\\nten years.\\nOR\\nHe or she should have been an advocate in one or more High Courts for at least ten\\nyears continuously without break.\\nOnce appointed, the High Court judges hold of fice till they attain the age of 62 years. After\\nretirement, they may be appointed judges of the Supreme Court or they may practise as\\nadvocates either in the Supreme Court or in any High Court other than the High Court in\\nwhich they served as judges.\\nA High Court judge may be removed before he or she attains the age of 62 years, only on\\nthe ground of incapacity or proved misbehaviour . He or she may be removed if both the\\nHouses of Parliament adopt a resolution by a majority of their total membership and by\\ntwo thirds majority of members present and voting, separately in each House in the same\\nsession. Such a resolution is submitted to the President, who then can remove the concerned\\njudge. This procedure is same as for removal of judges of the Supreme Court.'),\n",

Cases of alleged violation of\\nfundamental rights can be started in High Courts, or in the Supreme Court. The High\\nCourts have the power to issue orders to restore the fundamental rights of the people. You\\nwill recall that these orders are called writs.\\nPower  to Issue Writs: You have read in the  ‘Right to Constitutional Remedies’  in the\\nlesson on Fundamental Rights that the Supreme Courts and High Courts can issue writs\\nto ensure that rights of the people are not violated either by State or otherwise. The\\nConstitution has specifically given the power ‘to issue certain writs ’ to the High Courts.\\nThese Courts can issue writs (which are binding directions of the Court) to any person or\\nauthority , including government of the S tate concerned. The writs in the nature of Habeas,\\nCorpus , mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto , and certiorari  (explained in lesson 6)\\nfor the enforcement of rights of the people. This power is exercised in the original jurisdiction\\nof the High Court, and is not derogatory to similar power of the Supreme Court.\\nA High Court can hear election petition in its original jurisdiction, challenging the election\\nof a Member of Parliament or S tate Legislative Assembly . It can set aside the election of\\na member if it finds that he or she used corrupt means in his or her election. All the lower\\ncourts function under the superintendence control and guidance of the High Court in the\\nState.\\nHigh Courts hear appeals against the judgements of the subordinate courts. In civil cases,\\nappellate jurisdiction extends to all such cases which involve an amount exceeding\\nRs.5 lakh. Any party to a civil dispute, which is dissatisfied with the decision of the'),\n",

It\\nalso hears cases relating to patents and designs, succession, land acquisition, insolvency\\nand guardianship.\\nThe High Courts hear and decide appeals against decisions of the sessions courts in criminal\\ncases. An accused who is found guilty by a sessions court, and awarded a sentence may\\nfile an appeal against the verdict of the sessions court. Sometimes even State may appeal\\nagainst a sessions court judgement for enhancement of punishment. The High Court may\\naccept the decision of the sessions court, or alter it and increase or reduce the sentence, or\\nchange the nature of sentence, or may acquit an accused. However , if an accused is\\nawarded death sentence by the sessions court, the sentence must be confirmed by the\\nHigh Court before the person is hanged to death. Even if the accused does not file an\\nappeal against death sentence, the State refers it to the High Court for confirmation.\\n15.2.2 Transfer  of Cases to the High Cour t\\nIf a High Court is satisfied that a case pending in a subordinate court involves a substantial\\nquestion of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution, the High Court may withdraw\\nsuch a case from the lower court. After examining the case, the High Court may either\\ndispose it off itself, or may return it to the lower court with instructions for disposal of the\\ncase.\\n15.2.3 Superintendence of Subordinate Courts\\nA High Court has the right of superintendence and control over all the subordinate courts\\nin all the matter of judicial and administrative nature. In the exercise of its power of\\nsuperintendence, the High Court may call for any information from the lower courts; may\\nmake and issue general rules and prescribe norms for regulating the practice and\\nproceedings of these courts; and it may issue such directions, from time to time, as it may\\ndeem necessary .\\nIt can also make rules and regulations relating to the appointment, demotion, promotion\\nand leave of absence for the officers of the subordinate courts.\\n15.2.4 Court of Record\\nA High Court is also a court of record, like the Supreme Court. Lower courts in a State are\\nbound to follow the decisions of the High Court which are cited as precedents.

The judge of this court is appointed\\nby the Governor of the State.\\nBelow the Court of District Judge, there may be one or more courts of sub judges in the\\ndistrict. Separate family courts, which are equal to courts of sub judge, have been established\\nin districts to exclusively hear cases of family disputes, like divorce, custody of children,\\netc. Below them there are courts of munsifs and small causes courts which decide cases\\ninvolving petty amounts. No appeal can be made against the decisions of the small causes\\ncourts. All these courts hear and settle civil disputes.\\nThe Court of the District Judge (called the District Courts) hears not only appeals against\\nthe decisions of the courts of sub judges, but also some of the cases begin directly in the\\nCourt of District Judge itself. Appeals against the decisions of this court may be heard by\\nthe High Court of the State.\\nCivil Courts deal with cases pertaining to disputes between two or more persons regarding\\nproperty , divorce, contract, and breach of agreement or landlord – tenant disputes.\\n15.3.3 Criminal Courts\\nThe Court of the Sessions Judge (known as Sessions Courts) is the highest court for\\ncriminal cases in a district. Below this court, there are courts of magistrates of First,\\nSecond and Third class. In metropolitan cities like Delhi, Calcutta, Mumbai and Chennai,\\nFirst Class Magistrates are called Metropolitan Magistrates. All these criminal courts are\\ncompetent to try the accused and to award punishment, as sanctioned by law , to those\\nwho are found guilty of violation of law .\\nCriminal Courts hear criminal cases which are related to violation of laws. These cases\\ninvolve theft, dacoity , rape, arson, pick-pocketing, physical assault, murder etc. In such\\ncases the guilty person is awarded punishment. It may be fine, imprisonment or even\\ndeath sentence.\\nNormally every accused is presented by the police before a magistrate. The magistrate\\ncan finally dispose off cases of minor crime. But, when a magistrate finds prima-facie\\ncase of serious crime he/she may commit the accused to the sessions court. Thus, sessions\\ncourts try the accused who are sent upto them by the magistrate concerned.\\nAs mentioned above, an accused who is awarded death sentence by the sessions court,\\ncan be hanged to death only after his sentence is confirmed by the High Court.\\n15.3.4  Revenue Courts\\nRevenue courts deal with cases of land revenue in the State.

It is not the Central or the State government which immediately\\ncomes to your mind.

As local level democratic government, the municipal institutions\\nthat are elected by the local people, raise taxes and collect fees and fines from the public.\\nThey regulate city life by laying down regulations regarding buildings, road network and\\ngarbage disposal. There are many developmental activities undertaken by them like women\\nand child development, slums improvement etc. Municipal government has made possible\\nparticipative urban development and local management of civic facilities.\\n16.2 Reforms Intr oduced by the 74th Constitutional Amendment\\nThe recommendations and suggestions of several commissions and committees appointed\\nby the Central Government, from time to time, to improve the urban bodies resulted in the\\nenactment of the Constitution (Seventy-fourth Amendment) Act, 1992. Earlier , State\\nGovernments were free to manage their local bodies as they wished. The Amendment\\nmade statutory provisions for the establishment, empowerment and functioning of urban\\nlocal self-governing institutions. The main provisions of this Act can be grouped under two\\ncategories–compulsory and voluntary . Some of the compulsory provisions which are binding\\non all States are:\\n(i) Constitution of nagar panchayats, municipal councils and municipal corporations in\\nsmall, big and very big urban areas respectively;\\n(ii) Reservation of seats in urban local bodies for Scheduled Castes / Scheduled Tribes\\nroughly in proportion to their population;\\n(iii) Reservation of seats for women up to one-third seats;\\n(iv) The State Election Commission, constituted in order to conduct elections in the\\npanchayati raj bodies (see 73rd Amendment) will also conduct elections to the urban\\nlocal self- governing bodies;\\n(v) The State Finance Commission, constituted to deal with financial affairs of the\\npanchayati raj bodies also looks into the financial affairs of the local urban self-\\ngoverning bodies;\\n(vi) Tenure of urban local self-governing bodies is fixed at five years and in case of\\nearlier dissolution fresh elections are held within six months;\\nSome of the voluntary provisions which are not binding, but are expected to be observed\\nby the S tates are:\\n(i) Giving voting rights to members of the Union and State Legislatures in these bodies;\\n(ii) Providing reservation for backward classes;\\n(iii) Giving financial powers in relation to taxes, duties, tolls and fees, etc;\\n(iv) Making the municipal bodies autonomous and devolution of powers to these bodies\\nto perform some or all of the functions enumerated in the Twelfth Schedule added to\\nthe Constitution through this Act and/or to prepare plans for economic development.\\nIn accordance with the 74th Amendment, municipal corporations and municipalities (municipal\\nboards or municipal committees) are now regulated in a fairly uniform manner in all the\\nStates. However you must remember that local self-government continues to be a subject\\nin the State List. Thus, the 73rd and 74th amendments provide framework for the States in'),\n",

Thus, each State has its own Election Commission which\\nconducts elections to all local bodies after regular intervals of five years. Each State has\\nits Finance Commission to regulate finances of the local bodies. Seates are reserved in the\\ncorporations and municipalities for Scheduled Castes and Tribes. One-third seats are\\nreserved for women in all local bodies – urban and rural.\\n16.3 Composition\\nThe Municipal bodies are constituted of persons chosen by direct election from the territorial\\nconstituencies in the municipal area. However , the Legislature of a S tate may , by law ,\\nprovide for the representation in a municipal body of persons having special knowledge or\\nexperience of municipal administration, the members of Rajya Sabha, Lok Sabha and the\\nmembers of Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly of the S tate, representing\\nconstituencies, which comprise wholly or partly the Municipal area and the Chairpersons\\nof Wards Committees.\\nEmpowerment of weaker sections of society and women by reserving seats for such\\ngroups is one of the important constitutional provisions of the Constitutional Amendment.\\nThe offices of chairperson are also be reserved for SC/ST and women. Thus at least one\\nyear, out of five year duration of Municipal Corporation of Delhi, the of fice of Mayor is\\nreserved for a women, and one year is reserved for a Councillor of Scheduled Caste. It\\ngives a term of five years to the municipalities and if any of them is to be dissolved, it must\\nbe given an opportunity of being heard.\\nTo be able to understand the composition of urban local bodies, we give below a very brief\\naccount of Municipal Corporation of Delhi. This Corporation covers entire area of\\nDelhi, except small portion of New Delhi where seat of Union Government is situated.\\nThe Corporation has 134 elected members (Councillors). They are directly elected from\\nsingle-member wards on the basis of universal adult franchise. Several seats are reserved\\nfor women and for Scheduled Castes. It is elected for 5 years. Besides, there are 15\\npersons nominated by the Delhi Legislative Assembly . The Corporation functions through\\nvarious Committees – the standing committee being the most important. The political head\\nof the Corporation is the Mayor , elected by the Councillor for one year . A civil servant,\\ncalled the Municipal Commissioner is its administrative head. Most other Corporations are\\ngenerally based on this pattern.\\n16.4 Function of Urban Local Bodies\\nIt is a common practice to divide the organisation of a corporation or a municipality into\\ntwo parts: (a) the deliberative, and (b) the executive part. The corporation, council or\\nmunicipal board or council consisting of the elected representatives of the people constitutes\\nthe deliberative part. It acts like a legislature. It discusses and debates on general municipal\\npolicies and performance, passes the budget of the urban local body , frames broad policies\\nrelating to taxation, raising of resources, pricing of services and other aspects of municipal\\nadministration. It keeps an eye on municipal administration and holds the executive\\naccountable for what is done or not done. For instance, if water supply is not being properly\\nmanaged, or there is an outbreak of epidemic, the deliberative wing criticises the role of\\nthe administration and suggests measures for improvement. The executive part of municipal\\nadministration is looked after by the municipal officers and other permanent employees. In\\nthe corporations, the Municipal Commissioner is the executive head, and all other'),\n",

In a large corporation such as Delhi or Mumbai Municipal\\nCorporation the Commissioner is usually a senior IAS of ficer. In the municipalities, the\\nexecutive officer holds a similar position and looks after the overall administration of a\\nmunicipality .\\nMunicipal functions are generally classified into obligatory and discretionary types. The\\nobligatory (compulsary) functions are those that the municipal body must perform. In this\\ncategory fall such functions as water supply; construction and maintenance of roads,\\nstreets, bridges, subways and other public works, street lighting; drainage and sewerage;\\ngarbage collection and disposal; prevention and control of epidemics. Some other obligatory\\nfunctions are public vaccination and inoculation; maintenance of hospitals and dispensaries\\nincluding maternity and child welfare centres; checking food adulteration; removal of slums;\\nsupply of electricity; maintenance of cremation and burial grounds; and town planning. In\\nsome States some of these functions may be taken over by State Government.\\nThe discretionary functions are those that a municipal body may take up if funds permit.\\nThese are given less priority . Some of the discretionary functions are construction and\\nmaintenance of rescue homes and orphanages, housing for low income groups, organising\\npublic receptions, provision of treatment facilities, etc.\\nMunicipal Corporations take up more functions than municipalities. There are corporations\\nlike Delhi, Mumbai, Vadodara , Pune, Ahmedabad which are known for their various city\\ndevelopment activities in such areas as public transport, public parks and open spaces\\nincluding municipal zoo, and even milk and electricity supply .\\n16.4.1 Financial Resources of Urban Local Bodies\\nMunicipal corporations and municipalities raise their own resources from a variety of\\nsources, as provided for in the respective municipal laws. Their own revenue sources are\\nincome from (i) taxes, (ii) fees and fines, and (iii) earning from municipal enterprises like\\nland, tanks, markets, shops, etc. Besides these bodies receive grants from the State.\\nProperty tax on land and buildings is the most important source of income of most urban\\nlocal bodies. Other taxes levied by them are advertisement tax, professional tax etc. Octroi\\nstill remains an important source of income of municipalities in Western India. Now , the\\ntrend is toward abolishing this tax as it obstructs the free flow of traffic on highways. They\\nalso charge fines for breach of municipal rules and regulations. From municipal shops and\\nmarkets and rest houses, municipalities often earn considerable sum of revenue. It is a\\ngeneral practice for States to give grants to their municipal bodies to improve their revenue\\nposition. S tate grants-in-aid may be on ad hoc basis; or , it can be on the basis of certain\\nprinciples like size of population, slums concentration, location of town, etc.\\nSome of the taxes and rates collected by urban bodies are:\\nProperty Tax; Water tax for water supplied; Seweraging Tax, Fire Tax; Taxes on animals\\nand vehicles; Theatre Tax; Duty on transfer of Property; Octroi Duty on certain items\\nbrought into the city; Education Cess (T ax); and Professional Tax.\\nSome other sources of income are fines and fees such as Fees on Tehbazari on takhats\\nand chabutras; licence fees – on cycle rickshaw , bicycles etc.; rent from municipal shops;\\nand fines imposed for violation of municipal by laws.'),\n",

Under the British rule,\\npanchayats lost the respect and power which they had earlier enjoyed because of the new\\nsystem of courts, laws and revenue collection. Though in independent India one of the\\nDirective Principles of State Policy in the Constitution directed the Union and State\\nGovernments to try to take steps to organise village panchayats and give them such powers\\nand authority as may be necessary to enable them to act as units of self-government\\npanchayati raj was not taken up seriously by the states. However , they are now given\\nConstitutional status.'),\n",

This meant that panchayati raj should be set\\nup at three levels. They should be furnished with sufficient powers and resources. These\\nthree tiers of panchayati raj are:\\n/circle6zila parishad at district level;\\n/circle6panchayat samiti at intermediate or block level;\\n/circle6village or gram panchayat at village level.\\nIn this scheme, panchayat samiti was to be the most important. These three bodies were\\ninterlinked as the lower body was represented in the higher body through its chairperson.\\nPanchayati raj of the Balwant Rai Mehta Committee pattern was first introduced by\\nRajasthan in 1959. Later , other S tates also followed. Initially , both the people and the\\nstates were enthusiastic about Panchayati Raj. However panchayati raj institutions began\\nto decline very soon owing to government indifference and political interference.\\nThe Ashok Mehta  Committee  set up by the government to review panchayati raj\\nsubmitted its report in 1978. This Committee felt that panchayati raj had inculcated political\\nawareness among rural masses. However , it had not been successful in carrying out\\neconomic development. Unlike the Balwant Rai Mehta Committee, the Asoka Mehta\\nCommittee suggested a two tier str uctur e of panchayati raj. These two-tiers were to be:\\n/circle6 zila parishad at district level;\\n/circle6 mandal panchayat, an administrative unit between village panchayat and panchayat\\nsamiti. In the two-tier system, the main emphasis was laid on zila parishad and not on\\npanchayat samiti as in the case of the earlier committee report. However the\\nrecommendations of the Ashok Mehta Committee could not be implemented due to\\nthe collapse of the Janata Government in 1980.\\nThe S tates like Bihar , Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu did not hold elections to panchayats\\nfor long. At the same time, many new agencies were set up by the Central Government\\nlike -District Rural Development Agency , to take up development programmes in\\ncollaboration with the State Governments, with panchayats having no role in these\\nprogrammes. They themselves hardly had any funds to take up development projects in\\nthe villages.\\n16.5.2 Salient Featur es of 73rd Amendment\\nThe 73rd amendment to the Constitution enacted in 1992 made statutory provisions for the\\nestablishment, empowerment and functioning of Panchayati Raj institutions.

Exemption from the intermediate tier is given to the small States having less than\\n20 lakhs population. It means that they have freedom not to have the middle level of\\npanchayat. All members in a panchayat are directly elected. However , if a S tate so decides,\\nmembers of the State Legislature and Parliament may also be represented in district and\\nmiddle level panchayats. The middle level panchayats are generally known as Panchayat\\nSamitis. Provisions have been made for the inclusion of the chairpersons of the village\\npanchayats in the block and district level panchayats. The provision regarding reservation\\nof seats for Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes has already been mentioned earlier .\\nHowever it should also be noted here that one-third of total seats are reserved for women,\\nand one-third for women out of the Quota fixed for Scheduled Castes/T ribes.

State Legislatures can provide for further\\nreservation for other backward classes (OBC) in panchayats.\\n(i) Term\\nThe Amendment provides for continuous existence of panchayats. The normal term of a\\npanchayat is five years. If a panchayat is dissolved earlier , elections are held within six\\nmonths.

Responsibility may be given to them to prepare plans for economic development and\\nsocial justice. Schemes of economic development and social justice with regard to 29\\nimportant matters such as agriculture, primary and secondary education, health and\\nsanitation, drinking water , rural housing, welfare of weaker sections, social forestry and so\\nforth may be made by them.\\n16.7 Three-tier  Structur e of Panchayati Raj\\n(i) Panchayats at Village Level\\nThis is the basic or grasroots level of panchayati raj. The panchayat for a village or a\\ngroup of villages includes (a) Gram Sabha, the symbol of direct democracy; (b) Gram\\nPanchayat and (c) Nyaya Panchayat.\\n(a) Gram Sabha\\nRecognition to Gram Sabha, an institution of direct democracy , is an important feature of\\nthe 73rd amendment. Gram Sabha consists of all adult residents within a village or group of\\nvillages. Thus it is the only institution of direct democracy in the country .\\nGenerally , two meetings of Gram Sabha are held every year . In these meetings, the Gram\\nSabha as the general body of the people hear annual statement of accounts, audit or\\nadministrative report of panchayats. It also recommends new development projects to be\\nundertaken by panchayats. It also helps in identifying poor people of the village so that\\nthey may be given economic assistance.\\n(b) Gram Panchayat\\nThe lower tier of the panchayati raj system in the country is the village level panchayat. It\\nis known in most of the States as Gram Panchayat: The members of a Gram Panchayat\\nare directly elected by the people. The number of members of a Gram Panchayat is fixed\\non the basis of village population. Hence, it differs from panchayat to panchayat. Election\\nis held on the basis of single-member constituency . As already mentioned, one-third of the\\ntotal number of seats are reserved for women; and some for Scheduled Castes and Tribes\\nincluding one-third for women of Scheduled Castes and Tribes.\\nChairpersons of Gram Panchayats are called by different names in different States as\\n‘Sarpanch, Pradhan or President. There is a Vice-Chairperson also. Both are elected by\\nmembers of the panchayat. Gram Panchayats generally hold their meetings once a month.\\nPanchayats at all levels constitute committees for transaction of their business.\\n(c) Nyaya Panchayat\\nThese are judicial panchayats and reminder of ancient village panchayat that settled local\\ndisputes. They are set up to provide speedy and inexpensive justice. Jurisdiction of Nyaya\\nPanchayat varies from State to State – one such panchayat is set up for five or more gram\\npanchayats. Their tenure is between 3 and 5 years, as determined by S tate law . Nyaya\\nPanchayats generally deal with petty civil and criminal cases, and can impose fine upto'),\n",

There are no lawyers to plead the cases in Nyaya Panchayat. Parties to the\\ndisputes argue their own cases.\\n(ii) Panchayat Samiti\\nThe second or middle tier of the panchayati raj is Panchayat Samiti which provides a link\\nbetween Gram Panchayat and a Zila Parishad. The strength of a Panchayat Samiti also\\ndepends on the population in a samiti area. In Panchayat Samiti, some members are directly\\nelected. Sarpanchs of gram panchayats are ex-officio members of Panchayat Samitis.\\nHowever , all the sarpanchs of Gram Panchayats are not members of Panchayat Samitis\\nat the same time. The number varies from S tate to S tate and is rotated annually . It means\\nthat only chairpersons of some Gram Panchayats in a Samiti area are members of Panchayat\\nSamiti at a time. In some panchayats, members of Legislative Assemblies and Legislative\\nCouncils as well as members of Parliament who belong to the Samiti area are co-opted as\\nits members. Chairpersons of Panchayat Samitis are, generally elected from among the\\ndirectly elected members.\\n(iii) Zila Parishad\\nZila Parishad at the district level is the uppermost tier of the panchayati raj system. This\\ninstitution has some directly elected members whose number differs from State to State as\\nit is also based on population. Chairpersons of Panchayat Samitis are ex-officio members\\nof Zila Parishads. Members of Parliament, Legislative Assemblies and Councils belonging\\nto the districts are also nominated members of Zila Parishads.\\nThe chairperson of a Zila Pazishad, called Adhyaksha or President, is elected from among\\nthe directly elected members. The vice-chairperson is also elected similarly .\\nZila parishad meetings are conducted once a month. Special meetings can also be convened\\nto discuss special matters. Subject committees are also formed.\\nEx-of ficio:  A person who holds an of fice, not because he/she is elected to that post,\\nbut by virtue of the fact that he/she holds another office.\\n16.7.1 Functions of Panchayati Raj Institutions\\nAll panchayati raj institutions perform such functions as are specified in state laws relating\\nto panchayati raj. Generally speaking the functions are as under:\\n(i) Functions of Gram Panchayat\\nSome States distinguish between obligatory (compulsory) and optional functions of Gram\\nPanchayats while other States do not make this distinction. The civic functions relating to\\nsanitation, cleaning of public roads, drains and ponds, public toilets and lavatories, primary\\nhealth care, vaccination, supply of drinking water , constructing public wells, street lighting,\\nsocial health and primary and adult education, etc. are obligatory functions of village\\npanchayats. The optional functions depend on the resources of the panchayats. They may\\nor may not perform such functions as tree plantation on road sides, setting up of breeding\\ncentres for cattle, organising child and maternity welfare, promotion of agriculture, etc.\\nAfter the 73rd Amendment, the scope of functions of Gram Panchayat was widened. Such\\nimportant functions like preparation of annual development plan of panchayat area, annual\\nbudget, relief in natural calamities, removal of encroachment on public lands, implementation'),\n",

Selection of beneficiaries through Gram Sabhas, public distribution system,\\nnon-conventional energy source, improved Chullahs, bio-gas plants have also been given\\nto Gram Panchayats in some states.\\n(ii) Functions of Panchayat Samiti\\nPanchayat Samitis are at the hub of developmental activities. They are headed by Block\\nDevelopment Officers (B.D.Os). Some functions are entrusted to them like agriculture,\\nland improvement, watershed development, social and farm forestry , technical and\\nvocational education, etc. The second type of functions relates to the implementation of\\nsome specific plans, schemes or programmes to which funds are earmarked. It means\\nthat a Panchayat Samiti has to spend money only on that specific project. The choice of\\nlocation or beneficiaries is, however , available to the Panchayat Samiti.\\n(iii) Functions of Zila Parishad\\nZila Parishad links panchayat samitis within the district. It coordinates their activities and\\nsupervises their functioning. It prepares district plans and integrates samiti plans into district\\nplans for submission to the State Government.\\nZila Parishad looks after development works in the entire district. It undertakes schemes\\nto improve agricultural production, exploit ground water resources, extend rural electrification\\nand distribution and initiate employment generating activities, construct roads and other\\npublic works.\\nIt also performs welfare functions like relief during natural calamities and scarcity ,\\nestablishment of orphanages and poor homes, night shelters, welfare of women and children,\\netc.\\nIn addition, Zila Parishads perform functions entrusted to them under the Central and\\nState Government sponsored programmes.

For resources, panchayats depend mainly on grants from State Government.\\nThey also have taxation powers and have some income from owned or vested assets.\\nThey may get a share in the taxes, duties, tolls and fees that are levied and collected by the\\nState Government. Let us now see what financial resources panchayats have to perform\\ntheir functions.\\n(i) Gram Panchayat\\nIn most States th e power of levying taxes is vested in gram panchayats. House tax, tax on\\ncattle, immovable property , commercial crops, drainage tax, sanitation fee, tax on produce\\nsold in village, fee for supply of water to households, lighting tax are some of the taxes and\\nfees levied by panchayats. Panchayats can also levy entertainment tax on temporarily\\nstationed theatres, taxes on animals and non-mechanically propelled vehicles plied for\\nhire.\\nGram panchayats also receive funds as income from property owned by them as common\\ngrounds, jungles, cattle ground etc. The sale proceed of dung, refuse and carcasses (dead\\nbodies of animals) is also retained by gram panchayats. They also receive their share in\\nland revenue from the St ate.\\n(ii) Panchayat Samitis\\nPanchayat Samitis can impose tax on facilities provided by them as water for drinking or\\nirrigation purposes, lighting arrangements, tolls for bridges maintained by them. The property\\nof Panchayat Samitis includes public buildings, public roads constructed or maintained out\\nof their funds and all land or other property transferred to them by the government.\\nPanchayats receive income from the property vested in them. They also receive grants\\nfrom the State Governments. Funds are transferred by Zila Panchayats or State'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Hp\\\\Documents\\\\vscode\\\\prepbridge\\\\prepbridge\\\\data\\\\indian-polity.pdf', 'page': 176}, page_content='MODULE  - 3\\nNotes\\n175Local Government: Urban and Rural\\nStructur e of Government Governments along with schemes to be implemented by the intermediate institutions of\\npanchayati raj.\\nToll tax is char ged from those who use a facility . Thus, those who pass over a bridge\\nmay have a nominal amount of money as toll for the bridge.\\n(iii) Zila Parishads\\nZila Parishads are also authorised to impose taxes. They may impose taxes on persons\\ncarrying on business in rural areas for six months, taxes on brokers, commission agents in\\nmarkets established by them, also tax on sale of goods in these markets. Tax on land\\nrevenue can also be imposed by Zila Parishads. When development schemes are entrusted\\nto them, necessary funds are also provided. They also receive grants from the State,\\ndonations from charitable institutions, and may also raise loans.\\n16.9 Evaluation of Panchayati Raj\\nThe concept of grassroots democracy at both rural and urban levels has not flourished in\\nthe country . Some of the major reasons behind this failure are politicisation of administration,\\nentry of criminal elements in the elected bodies, rampant corruption, caste and group\\ndivision, priority to self interest over public welfare and electoral malpractices. The 73rd\\namendment seeks to radically alter the power relations in the villages by reserving seats\\nfor scheduled castes, tribes, backward classes and women. However , in the absence of\\nproper education, training and economic independence, these groups are unable to assert\\nthemselves. Illiteracy poverty and unemployment are the major handicaps. Urgent steps\\nneed to be taken to effectively deal with these problems in order to facilitate participatory\\ndevelopment. Though the provision for reservation of seats for women has been manipulated\\nby their male counterparts – mostly their husbands – it has certainly empowered them to\\nsome extent. They are increasingly becoming aware of their rights and responsibilities and\\nare asserting themselves in certain cases. This is definitely a very positive development.\\nThe latest Constitutional Amendments have certainly broadened the financial resources of\\nthe local self-governing institutions. However they still remain starved of funds. Taxation\\npowers have been given to them but they are unable to collect enough taxes. So due to\\nscarcity of resources, panchayats are not able to fulfil their role as self-governing institutions\\nor carriers of economic development in the countryside. Panchayats are subject to various\\ncontrols by the State Governments. The State Governments are authorised to cancel their\\nresolutions and even dissolve them. However the 73rd Constitutional Amendment has made\\nit compulsory for the States to hold election of panchayati raj bodies within six months of\\ntheir dissolution.\\nIt is necessary that the people participate actively in democratically elected panchayats.\\nThis can be ensured through Gram Sabhas. Through Gram Sabhas, the people can question\\nand demand explanation from panchayats. Gram Sabha can harmonise needs and priorities\\nof people and also plan direction of village development. The Gram Sabhas can successfully\\nplay the role of securing democracy at the grassroots if they are endowed with sufficient\\nauthority .\\nThe overall socio-economic and cultural development of rural areas depends on strong\\npanchayats. Panchayats as the foundations of democracy at the grassroots can be'),\n",

Urban local bodies frame policies for the cities and towns, raise revenue\\nand pass their own budgets. The most important source of revenue of urban local bodies is\\nthe property tax imposed on land and buildings. Grants-in-aid from the Government  constitute\\nanother-major source of revenue. Urban local government is the major supplier of essential\\ncivic services and facilities in our urban areas and it represents grassroots democracy at\\nthe local level.\\nPanchayat is the most ancient institution at the village level in our country . Panchayats\\nhave been functioning as primary institutions of democracy at the grassroots level. The\\n73rd amendment gave them constitutional status.

Society is a complex network of social\\nrelations. The individuals entering these relationships are in perpetual change. Therefore, every society searches\\nfor an order and also mechanisms to cope with these changes. Emergence of the state or political order is a\\nparty of this complex process. The concerns of political order and the way it carries those functions and the\\nproblems that it faces are of universal concern. The concerns of political order have further increased with the\\nnew role viz. changing the large socio-economic order so as to improve the living conditions. Political Science\\ndeals with this vital domain of the society , keeping in mind the changed scenario.\\nThe subject of Political Science seeks to enable the students to gain critical awareness about the political\\ninstitutions which govern their lives. These institutions are created to maintain peace, order and co-operation,\\nwhich would otherwise be threatened by conflicts over socio-ethnic identities or religious beliefs, etc.\\nThis course seeks to impart knowledge about political institutions which operate at the village, city , district,\\nnational and global levels. Thus, segments of the course deal with nation-state, panchayati raj, district\\nadministration, central and state governments as well as United Nations and World Order . It also deals with\\nproblems, issues, concerns and political processes that arise in the working of the system.\\nThe Political Science syllabus deals not only with political institutions but also with the political ideas. Those\\nideas deal with the nature, needs, competence, partaining to justice, liberty , equality , rights, obligations etc. of\\nthe people. They also deal with the requirements, responsibilites and limits of political authority . Thus, the study\\nof Political Science is concerned with the role and responsibilities of governmental agencies at various levels.\\nPolitical Science focuses on the study of the state, nation, society , government etc. In this course for the\\nNational Institute of Open Schooling this primary focus remained at the background as well as  was the\\nreference point. The attempt is is to strenthen the intellectual capabilites of the students not only to appreciate\\nthe theoretical concerns but their application in the concrete context. For this purpose, Indian Political system\\nand its unfolding experience is incorporated in this syllabus.\\nThe subject-matter primarily deals with four important aspects: (i) the theoretical framework; (ii) the Indian\\nconstitutional framework with a focus on the institutions and organs of the government; (iii) the processes and\\npractices flowing from the constitution in action; and (iv) our relationship with the world outside.\\nCourse Objectives\\n/circle6 To develop in the learners an interest in the theory and principles of Political Science.\\n/circle6 To provide an understanding of the underlying philosophy and the logic of the Indian Constitution.\\n/circle6 To expose the learner to the institutions and or gans through which the power is structured and exercised.\\n/circle6 To develop among learners an insight into various political processes and practices.\\n/circle6 To sensitise the learners to the democratic values and emer ging national and global concerns so as to\\nenable them to become responsible citizens and agents of democratic governance.\\n/circle6 To acquaint learners with attitudes and values necessary for healthy civic and political life.\\nCourse S tructure\\nThe present curriculum in Political Science has been divided into six core modules namely , Individual and the\\nState, Aspects of the Constitution of India., S tructure of Government, Democracy at work, Major Contemporary\\n181'),\n",

In a country which is vast and has a large population,\\nthe establishment of direct democracy is an impossible task, except in some cases at the\\nlocal level of governance.

In fact one of\\nthe major demands in the long-drawn struggle for democracy in the world has been the\\nacceptance of the principle of universal adult franchise, as the basis of ascertaining the\\nwishes of people. Till the second decade of the twentieth century , not all the countries\\nwere practising universal adult franchise. Many democratic systems had restricted to male\\nfranchise only , based on property , education and other qualifications.\\nIt is interesting to note that most of the western countries, which are known for their long\\nexperience of some sort of representative system of governance, introduced adult franchise\\nonly in the wake of the First World War (1914 – 18), a war which was proclaimed to be\\nfought by the Allied Powers (Great Britain, France and United S tates and the allies) to\\nmake the ‘world safe for democracy’.

In 1918, Britain had granted franchise to limited\\nnumber of women. It was decided that while all adult men, 21 years of age and above\\nwould have the right to vote, women only above the age of 30 years could possess the\\nright to vote. This discrimination was removed only in 1928.\\nFrance, the land that gave the popular slogans of Liberty , Equality and Fraternity , could\\nintroduce the right of universal adult franchise to its people only after the end of the\\nSecond World War i.e. 1945. Equally strange is the fact that Switzerland, the home of\\ndirect democracy denied the right to vote to women till 1973. India adopted the principle of\\nuniversal adult franchise when the present Constitution was enacted in 1949 which as you\\nknow was implemented on January 26, 1950.\\nAge of voting\\nThe voting age varies from country to country . In Denmark and Japan, a person, man or\\nwoman, is entitled to vote after attaining the age of 25 years. In Norway , the age limit is\\n23, in Great Britain, the United S tates, Russia and Turkey it is 18. In Switzerland, it is 20\\nyears.

They do so by electing their representatives who govern to serve and protect the\\ninterests of the people. There are two main methods of electing representatives. These\\nare known as Territorial and Functional representation.\\nTerritorial Repr esentation\\nThis is the most popular method of electing representatives in most of the democratic\\ncountries. In this system all eligible voters living in a specified area vote to elect their\\nrepresentative. The total electorate of the country , irrespective of their profession or group\\nis divided into territorial constituencies, which elect one or more representatives. The\\nentire population is devided into constituencies with more or less equal number of voters.\\nFunctional Representation\\nFunctional representation means that representatives are elected by various professional\\nand functional groups like – industrial workers, trading functionaries, medical practitioners,\\nlawyers, teachers, transporters, etc. According to this method separate constituencies are\\nset up for people belonging to specific group. For example, there may be a constituency of\\nteachers who elect their representative.\\nThe electorate is professionally or functionally categorised and each of professional\\ncategories is called upon to elect one or more representatives, irrespective of their place\\nof residence in the country . Unlike the territorial representation the electorate is not divided\\non the basis of territorial constituencies but on the basis of their profession. It is a scheme\\nof representation to various occupational groups.\\nConstituency\\nA body of voters who elect a representative is known as constituency . The body of voters\\nmay belong to a particular geographical area. The constituencies for Lok Sabha and\\nAssembly elections consist of voters of respective areas. But the constituency for the\\nelection of President of India consists of the Members of Parliament and S tate Assemblies.\\nThere may be single-member constituency or multi-member constituency .\\nSingle Member Constituency  When only one member is elected from a constituency , it is\\nknown as single member constituency . For Lok Sabha elections the whole of India is\\ndivided into 543 single member constituencies. Out of these 543 constituencies, every\\nstate and Union Territory has a share of certain number of constituencies. The system of'),\n",

Such constituencies exist in Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden and Italy .\\nAccording to this system, the whole country is divided into large constituencies and from\\neach constituency many representatives are elected. The political parties get the seats in\\nproportion to the votes they secure in concerned constituencies.\\nIn a multi-member constituency , usually the method of proportional representation is adopted.\\nFor being elected, a candidate has to achieve a fixed quota of votes. The voters have to\\nvote for as many representatives as are to be elected from their respective constituencies.\\nThey indicate their order of preferences against the names of candidates. We will discuss\\nthe details of their method when we study proportional representation.\\nPeople, therefore, exercise their right to vote according to electoral system adopted in\\ntheir respective countries. we shall discuss below the most important systems.\\n17.4 Simple Majority System\\nSimple majority system means that in case of a single-member constituency , the person or\\nthe candidate getting the highest number of votes is declared elected. The result is decided\\nby the majority of votes secured by a candidate. Many a time in this system, there is a\\nmulti-cornered contest, as the number of candidates is more than two. There are cases\\nwhere four or five or even more than five candidates contest. In such a situation, a candidate\\nwith even less than 50 percent of the total votes gets elected. Such cases are very often\\nfound in India, and elsewhere. The system of simple majority system is prevalent in Britain,\\nUSA, Canada and some other countries.\\nThis simple majority system is also called the first past the post system . Members of our\\nLok Sabha and the S tate Assemblies are elected by this system.\\n17.5 Proportional Representation System\\nThe system of proportional representation is an electoral device to ensure representation\\nof all sections of the people more or less in proportion to their voting strength. Under this\\nsystem any group, whether it is a political party or interest group will secure representation\\nin proportion to the popular votes it obtains.\\nJ.S. Mill was an ardent advocate of proportional representation. He said, “In any really\\nequal democracy every or any section would be represented not disproportionately , but\\nproportionately . A majority of the electors would always have a majority of representatives;\\nbut a minority of electors would always have a minority of representatives.” This system\\nensures that the number of seats a political party gets in the legislature should be in proportion\\nto the support of the popular votes. Sometimes in the simple majority system it is seen that\\na party gets more seats in the legislature even though it receives less percentage of votes\\nor a candidate with even less than 50 percent of votes is declared elected. For instance, in\\nIndia, in 1971 Lok Sabha elections, Congress polled only 46 percent votes yet it managed\\n351 seats out of 522. That is, even with less than 50 percent votes, Congress won 68\\npercent of the seats in the Lok Sabha. This limitation of the first-past-the-post system may'),\n",

There are two methods by which\\nproportional representation is secured.\\n1. The Single Transferable Vote System\\nIt is also called the Hare system or the Andrae Scheme. According to the single transferable\\nvote system each voter can cast only one vote which can be transferred to other candidates,\\nif necessary , according to the preference of the voter . Therefore, this system is also called\\nthe preferential system.\\nThis system works under following conditions:\\n(a) Every constituency should be a multi-member constituency , electing three or more\\nmembers.\\n(b) A voter has only single effective vote which may be cast in order of preference –\\nfirst, second, third or as many preferences as there are candidates. The voter writes\\n1, 2, 3 and so on against the names of the candidates of his choice.\\n(c) But the voter cannot cast all his preferences in favour of only one candidate.\\n(d) In order to be elected, a candidate must secure a certain quota of votes. The quota\\nis determined by dividing the total votes cast by the number of seats in the constituency .\\nTotal number of votes polled Quota 1 \\nTotalnumber of seats in the constituency = + \\nFor instance, if the number of seats in a constituency is 3 and total number of votes cast is\\n20,000. The quota will be\\nThe counting of votes begins with the first preference votes. A candidate securing the\\nprescribed quota on the basis of the first preference votes is declared elected, and his\\nsurplus votes, if any , are transferred to the candidates having second preference indicated\\non the ballot papers and so on.\\nIf one or more seats are left vacant because some candidates do not secure the required\\nquota, the candidates getting least number of votes are eliminated and their votes are\\ntransferred according to the preferences of the voters.\\nThis system has been adopted in India for the election of the members of the Rajya Sabha\\nand State Legislative Councils. This method is also followed for the election of President\\nof India.\\n2.  List System\\nThis is another method of proportional representation. Under this system, large multi-\\nmember constituencies are formed and many candidates are elected from each\\nconstituency . Each political party submits a list of its candidates for election from a particular\\nconstituency . A voter votes not to individuals but to the lists of candidates of dif ferent\\npolitical parties. These votes are indivisible. If 4 representatives are to be elected from the'),\n",

The\\nvoter has to select all the four candidates from either of the list.\\nA quota is determined, and the candidates are declared elected according to the quota of\\nvotes secured by policital parties. A party entitled to three seats, according to the quota\\nwill declare the first three candidates on its list elected. There are two forms of list system\\n– the ‘bound list’ and the ‘free list’. In ‘bound list’ a voter has no choice except to endorse\\nor reject the entire list of candidates prepared by a political party . But, in a free list, the\\nvoter while selecting the list can give his or her own order of preferences for the candidates.\\nList system is followed for elections in Switzerland.\\n17.6 Other Minority Representation System\\nApart from proportional representation, some other electoral methods have also been\\ndevised to ensure adequate representation to the minority groups in the legislature. These\\nsystems of minority representation are as follows:\\n(1) Cumulative Vote System: According to this system a voter has as many votes as\\nthe number of seats in the constituency . The voters has options. He or she can cast\\nvote for all the candidates or concentrate all his or her votes for just one candidate.\\nFor example, if 5 members are to be elected, the voter may give his or her vote to\\nonly one candidate or distribute it among  a few or all candidates. This system, therefore,\\nmay provide an opportunity to a well organised minority to elect its representative by\\ncumulating all its votes in favour of its own candidate.\\n(2) Limited Vote Plan: This system is adopted in a multi-member constituency from\\nwhere a minimum of 3 candidates are to be elected. Under this system every voter\\ncan vote for more than one candidate, but he or she cannot vote for all the candidates.\\nThat is why , it is known as the limited vote system. For example, if there are 6 seats\\nin a constituency , every voter will have right to vote only for 4 candidates. The voter\\nhas to vote for different candidates of his or her choice, but he or she cannot vote for\\nmore than 4 candidates.\\n17.7 The Second Ballot System\\nIn election, if there are only two candidates contesting election for a single seat, the one\\nwho secures a clear majority (at least 50 percent + 1) is declared elected. But when there\\nare more than two candidates, it may be the case that none of the candidates secures an\\nabsolute majority . In this case, second ballot is held, which means votes are again cast\\nafter a few days. In this second ballot only two candidates, who had secured maximum\\nnumber of votes in the first poll remain in the field. After voting, one who secures more\\nthan 50 percent of votes is declared elected.\\nFor example, in a constituency , three candidates are contesting election. The total number\\nof votes polled are 12,000. Candidate A secures 5000 votes, candidate B secures 4000\\nvotes, and candidate C secures 3000 votes. In such a situation no candidate gets absolute\\nmajority , that is 6001 votes. This necessitates holding of a second ballot. The candidate (in\\nthis case, candidate C) who has secured least number of votes is dropped. As such, the\\ncontest now remains between A and B. If B secures majority at the second poll then B\\nand not A will be declared successful. This system is practiced in France for the election\\nof President and the National Assembly .'),\n",

It means that each man or woman after attaining a prescribed\\nage (such as 18 years in India) is entitled to vote in the elections without any discrimination\\non grounds of caste, creed, religion, language or sex. The citizens exercise their right to\\nvote in order to choose their representatives in elections. Elections are, in fact, the bedrock\\nof democracy and express the sovereign will of the people through the exercise of their\\nfree and equal vote.\\nYou have also learnt that there are two alternative systems of representation – Territorial\\nand Functional. Under the territorial system, the country is divided into territorial\\nconstituencies and voters of each constituency elect their representatives. Territorial system\\nis quite popular , and in India, the elections to Lok Sabha and Legislative Assemblies are\\nheld on territorial basis. Functional representation implies that the people elect their\\nrepresentatives on the basis of their different occupational and professional affiliations.\\nThus, teachers, managers, industrialists, traders, workers, etc. elect their respective\\nrepresentatives.\\nThe simple majority system in usually followed is single-member constituencies where the\\ncandidate simply securing the highest number of votes is declared elected. This system\\ndoes not ensure adequate representation to all sections of the electorate. The system of\\nproportional representation is followed to provide representation to the minorities in\\nproportion to their voting strength.

The Constitution of India provides for an\\nElection Commission of India which is responsible for superintendence direction and control\\nof all elections. It is responsible for conducting elections to both the Houses of Parliament\\nand S tate Legislatures and for the of fices of President and Vice-President. Besides, it is\\nalso responsible for the preparation revision, updation and maintenance of lists of voters. It\\ndelimits constituencies for election to the Parliament and the State Legislatures, fixes the\\nelection programme and settles election disputes. It performs many other functions related\\nto elections.\\n18.1.1 Composition\\nThe Election Commission consists of the Chief Election Commissioner and such other\\nElection Commissioners as may be decided by the President from time to time. Ever since\\nthe first Chief Election Commissioner was appointed in 1950, there was no other Election\\nCommissioner till 1989. The Chief Election Commissioner was assisted by a larger number\\nof officials. The Election Commission became a multi-member body on 16 October 1989\\nwhen the President appointed two more Election Commissioners. The senior of the two\\nElection Commissioners is appointed as the Chief Election Commissioner .\\n18.1.2 Tenur e and Removal\\nChief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners are appointed for a term\\nof six years, or till the age of 65 whichever is earlier . It is important that Chief Election\\nCommissioner and other Election Commissioners should be free from all political\\ninterferences. Therefore, even if they are appointed by the President, they cannot be\\nremoved by him. And no changes can be brought in the conditions of service and the\\ntenure of office after their appointment. The Chief Election Commissioner cannot be\\nremoved from office, except on the grounds and in the manner on which the Supreme\\nCourt judges can be removed. However , since the other Election Commissioners and the\\nRegional Election Commissioners work under the Chief Commissioner , they may be\\nremoved by the President on his recommendations.\\n18.2 Powers and Functions of The Election Commission\\nThe primary function of the Election Commission is to conduct free and fair elections in\\nIndia. For this purpose, the Election Commission has the following functions:\\n18.2.1 Delimitation of Constituencies\\nTo facilitate the process of elections, a country has to be divided into several constituencies.\\nConstituency  It is territorial area from where a candidate contests elections\\nThe task of delimiting constituencies is generally performed by the Delimitation Commission\\nconsisting of five serving or retired judges of the Supreme Court and the Chief Election\\nCommissioner who is its ex-of ficio member . All secretarial assistance (at all levels, national,\\nstate, district) is provided to the Delimitation Commission by the Election Commission.\\nThe Delimitation Commission is constituted by the Government from time to time.'),\n",

It is known as the Electoral Roll, or\\nthe Voters’  List. The Commission prepares the Electoral Roll for Parliament as well as\\nLegislative Assembly elections. The Electoral Roll of every constituency contains the\\nnames of all the persons who have right to vote in that constituency . The electoral roll is\\nalso revised from time to time generally before every general election, by-election and\\nmid-term election in the constituency .\\nGeneral Election Election to constitute a new Lok Sabha or Assembly is\\ncalled General Election.\\nBy-Election If at any time there is a mid-term vacancy due to the death\\nor resignation of a member either in Lok Sabha or\\nLegislative Assembly only one seat falls vacant. The\\nelection for that seat is known as by-election.\\nMid-term Election If the Lok Sabha or S tate Assembly is dissolved before\\ncompletion of five years and the election is held to constitute\\nnew Lok Sabha or new S tate Assembly , etc. is called mid-\\nterm election.\\nThe revision is carried out from house to house by the enumerators appointed by Election\\nCommission and all eligible voters are registered. A person can be registered as a voter if\\nhe/she fulfils the following conditions:\\n1. He/she is a citizen of India.\\n2. He/she is 18 years of age.\\n3. He/she is resident of the constituency .\\n18.2.3 Recognition of Political Parties\\nOne of the important functions of the Election Commission is to recognise political parties\\nas all India (National) or State (Regional) Political Parties. If in a general election, a\\nparticular party gets four percent of the total valid votes polled in any four states it is\\nrecognised as an all India (National) Party . If a party gets four percent of the total valid\\nvotes in a state, it is recognized as a S tate or regional party . (You will read in details about\\nPolitical Parties in the following Lesson No.19). The Indian National Congress, the Bharatiya\\nJanata Party (BJP), the Communist Party of India (CPI), The Communist Party of India\\n(Marxist) the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Nationalist Congress Party are at\\npresent (2006) major recognised national parties.\\n18.2.4 Allotment of Symbol\\nPolitical Parties have symbols which are allotted by the Election Commission. For example,\\nHand is the symbol of the Indian National Congress, Lotus is the symbol of the Bharatiya\\nJanata Party (BJP) and Elephant is the symbol of Bahujan Samaj Party . These symbols\\nare significant for the following reasons:\\n1. They are a help for the illiterate voters who cannot read the names of the candidates.\\n2. They help in differentiating between two candidates having the same name.'),\n",

The candidate is required to be duly proposed and seconded by at least two voters\\nregistered in the concerned constituency . Every candidate has to take an oath or make\\naffirmation. These papers are then submitted to the Returning Officer designated by the\\nElection Commission.\\n18.4.3 Security Deposit\\nEvery candidate has to make a security deposit at the time of filing nomination. For Lok\\nSabha every candidate has to make a security deposit of Rs.10,000/- and for S tate Assembly\\nRs. 5,000. But candidates belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are required\\nto deposit Rs. 5,000/– for if contesting the Lok Sabha elections and Rs. 2,500/– for contesting\\nVidhan Sabha elections. The security deposit is forfeited if the candidate fails to get at\\nleast 1/6 of the total valid votes polled.\\n18.4.4 Scrutiny and Withdrawal\\nAll nomination papers received by the Returning Officer are scrutinised on the day fixed\\nby the Election Commission. This is done to ensure that all papers are filled according to\\nthe procedure laid down and accompanied by required security deposit. The Returning\\nOfficer is empowered to reject a nomination paper on any one of the following ground:\\n(i) If the candidate is less than 25 years of age.\\n(ii) If he/she has not made security deposit.\\n(iii) If he/she is holding any office of profit.\\n(iv) If he/she is not listed as a voter anywhere in the country\\nThe second day after the scrutiny of nomination papers is the last date for the withdrawal\\nof the candidates. In case that day happens to be a holiday or Sunday , the day immediately\\nafter that is fixed as the last day for the withdrawal.\\n18.4.5 Election Campaign\\nCampaigning is the process by which a candidate tries to persuade the voters to vote for\\nhim rather than others. During this period, the candidates try to travel through their\\nconstituency to influence as many voters as possible to vote in their favour . In the recent\\ntimes, the Election Commission has granted all the recognised National and Regional Parties,\\nfree access to the S tate-owned electronic media, the All India Radio (AIR) and the\\nDoordarshan to do their campaigning. The total free time is fixed by the Election Commission\\nwhich is allotted to all the political parties. Campaigning stops 48 hours before the day of\\npolling. A number of campaign techniques are involved in the election process. Some of\\nthese are:\\ni. Holding of public meetings\\nii. Distribution of handbills, highlighting the main issues of their election manifesto (election\\nmanifesto is a document issued by political party .

It comes into force the moment schedule of\\nelection is announced by the Election Commission. The code of conduct is as follows :\\n(i) Political Parties and contesting candidates should not use religious places for election\\ncampaign.\\n(ii) Such speeches should not be delivered in a way to create hatred among different\\ncommunities belonging to different religions, castes and languages, etc.\\n(iii) Official machinery should not be used for election work.\\n(iv) No new grants can be sanctioned, no new schemes or projects can be started once\\nthe election dates are announced.\\n (v) One cannot misuse mass media for partisan coverage.\\n18.4.7 Scrutinisation of Expenses\\nThough the Election Commission provides free access for a limited time to all the recognised\\nNational and State parties for their campaign, this does not mean that political parties do\\nnot spend anything on their elections campaign. The political parties and the candidates\\ncontesting election spend lar ge sum of amount on their election campaign. However , the\\nElection Commission has the power to scrutinise the election expenses to be incurred by\\nthe candidates. There is a ceiling on expenses to be incurred in Parliamentary as well as\\nState Assembly elections. Every candidate is required to file an account of his election\\nexpenses within 45 days of declaration of results. In case of default or if the candidate has\\nincurred (expenses) more than the prescribed limit, the Election Commission can take\\nappropriate action and the candidate elected may be disqualified and his election may be\\ncountermanded.\\n18.4.8 Polling, Counting and Declaration of Result\\nIn order to conduct polling, lar ge number of polling booths are set up in each constituency .\\nEach booth is placed under the charge of a Presiding Officer with the Polling Officers to\\nhelp the process.\\nA voter casts his/her vote secretly in an enclosure, so that no other person comes to know\\nof the choice he/she has made.

The voter has to press\\nthe appropriate button to vote for the candidate of his/her choice. As soon as the button is\\npressed, the machine is automatically switched of f. Then comes the turn of the next voter .\\nThe machine is easy to operate, and with this the use of ballot paper and ballot boxes is\\ndone away with.

The political\\nparties collect funds from companies and business houses, and then use this money to\\ninfluence the voter to vote in their favour . The business contributions are mostly in cash\\nand are not unaccounted. Many other corrupt practices are also adopted during election\\nsuch as bribing, rigging or voters intimidation, impersonation and providing transport and\\nconveyance of voters to and fro the polling stations. The reports of liquor being distributed\\nin poor areas are frequent during election.\\n18.5.2 Muscle Power\\nEarlier the criminals used to support the candidates by intimidating the voter at a gunpoint\\nto vote according to their direction. Now they themselves have come out openly by\\ncontesting the elections leading to criminalisation of politics. As a result violence during\\nelections has also increased.\\n18.5.3 Caste and Religion\\nGenerally the candidates are given tickets by the political parties on the consideration\\nwhether the candidate can muster the support of numerically larger castes and communities\\nand possesses enough resources. Even the electorates vote on the caste and communal\\nlines. Communal loyalties of the voters are used at the time of propaganda campaign.\\n18.5.4 Misuse of government machinery\\nAll the political parties do not have equal opportunity in respect of access to resources.\\nThe party in power is always in advantageous position then the opposition parties. There\\nis widespread allegation that the party in power accomplishes misuse of government\\nmachinery .\\nAll these features lead to violence, booth capturing, rigging bogus voting, forcible removal\\nof ballot papers, ballot boxes burning of vehicles, etc. which result into loss of public faith\\nin elections.\\n18.6 Electoral Reforms\\nIn order to restore the confidence of the public in the democratic electoral system, many\\nelectoral reforms have been recommended from time to time by Tarkunde Committee and\\nGoswami Committee which were particularly appointed to study and report on the scheme\\nfor Electoral Reforms in the year 1974 and 1990 respectively . Out of these recommendations\\nsome have been implemented. In fact, it was under the chairmanship of the then Chief\\nElection Commissioner , T.N. Seshan, that Election Commission initiated many more\\nmeasures to ensure free and fair elections. Some of the reforms which have been\\nimplemented so far are as follows:\\n1. The voting age has been lowered from 21 years to 18 years. This has helped increase\\nthe number of voters and response confidence in the youth of the country .\\n2. Another landmark change has been the increase in the amount of security deposit by\\nthe candidate to prevent many nonserious condidates from contesting elections with\\na ulterior motive.'),\n",

With the introduction of Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) the voting capturing, rigging,\\nand bogus voting may not be possible. The use of EVM will in the long run result in\\nreducing the cost of holding elections and also the incidence of tampering during\\ncounting of votes.\\n5. If a discrepancy is found between the member of votes polled and number of total\\nvotes counted, the Returning officer away report the matter forthwith to Election\\nCommission. Election Commission on such report may either declare the poll at the\\nparticular polling station as void and give a date for fresh poll or countermand election\\nin that constituency .\\nThere is no doubt that India needs drastic poll reforms but still the fact remains that Indian\\nelections have been largely free and fair and successfully conducted.

In fact a successful democracy requires a healthy party-system\\nfor its sustenance. Political parties are instruments through which citizens choose those\\nwho constitute the government. They explain merits and dangers of alternate policies and\\nprovide political education to the citizens.\\nObjectives\\nAfter studying this lesson, you will be able to\\n/circle6 recognise the importance of political parties;\\n/circle6 identify the different types of party system;\\n/circle6 recall the features of Indian party-system;\\n/circle6 distinguish between national and regional parties;\\n/circle6 describe the ideals and objectives of major national parties;\\n/circle6 appreciate the role of these national parties in sustaining India’ s democratic system.\\n 19.1 Meaning and Role of Political Parties\\nHuman beings have always organised themselves in groups and larger formations.

Other parties and groups originated later . The Indian National\\nCongress was formed as a response to the colonial rule and to achieve independence from\\nthe British rule.\\nAfter independence and with the adoption of a democratic Constitution, a new party system\\nemerged in the wake of the first general elections based on universal adult franchise in\\n1952. In preceding lesson you have learnt about the universal adult franchise in detail.\\nDuring the post-independence period, the party system passed through various phases.\\nThe first phase is known as the phase of one-party dominance because with the exception\\nof Kerala during 1956–59, the ruling party both at the Centre and in the states was the\\nCongress. The second phase (1967–1975) saw the emergence of a multi-party system in\\nIndia. In the Assembly elections in 1967, Congress was defeated in eight S tates. For the\\nfirst time non-Congress parties formed governments in these states. These parties formed\\ncoalition governments. Then came the split in Congress into Congress (O) and Congress\\n(N). However , the Congress again became a dominant force at the Centre after winning\\n1971 mid-term poll. Then came the emergency period (1975–77) which is known as the\\nauthoritarian period of Indian democracy .\\nWith the lifting of emer gency , the dominance of Congress ended. In the general elections\\nof 1977 Congress was defeated by the Janata Party . Janata Party came into existence as\\na result of the merger of many opposition parties. But again in 1980 general elections\\nCongress came back to power and remained in power till 1989.\\nJanata Party emerged out of the merger of Congress (O) led by Morarji Desai, Bharatiya\\nLok Dal led by Ch. Charan Singh, Congress for Democracy (CFD) led by Jagjivan Ram\\nand H.N. Bahuguna, the socialists led by George Fernandes and Jana Sangh led by L.K.\\nAdvani.\\nIn 1989 elections, the National Front joined government with the support of BJP and the\\nLeft Front. But this formation could not last its tenure and elections for the tenth Lok\\nSabha were held in May-June, 1991. Congress again formed government at the Centre. In\\n1996 general elections BJP emerged as the single largest party and was asked to form\\ngovernment at the Centre. Since it could not prove its majority within the given time it had\\nto resign. The United Front which was a combination of thirteen parties, formed the\\ngovernment at the Centre with the external support of the Congress and the CPI(M). But\\nthis government also could not last its full term. Although the coalition government formed\\nunder the leadership of BJP after 1998 elections was defeated in Lok Sabha, the 1999\\nelections again provided them the opportunity to form government which lasted its full\\nterm under a multi-party coalition, known as National Democratic Alliance (NDA).\\nIn the 14th general elections held in 2004, Congress emer ged as the single lar gest party .

National\\nparties are those which generally have influence all over the country . It is not necessary\\nthat a national party will have equal strength in all the states; it varies from State to State.\\nA party is recognised as a national party by the Election Commission on the basis of a\\nformula. The political party which has secured not less than four percent of the total valid\\nvotes in the previous general elections at least in four states, is given the status of a\\nnational party .\\nThe number of national parties has been changing. In the year 2006, Indian National\\nCongress, Bharatiya Janata Party , Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)], Communist\\nParty of India (CPI), Bahujan Samaj Party , and the Nationalist Congress Party were\\nnational parties.\\nHowever , there are other parties in India, which do not enjoy national influence. Their\\nactivities and influence are restricted to particular states or regions. Sometimes these\\nparties are formed to voice demands of a specific region. These parties are neither weak\\nnor short-lived. Sometimes they prove to be very powerful in their respective regions.\\nThese are known as regional parties. Major regional parties are AIADMK and DMK in\\nTamil Nadu, Telugu Desam in Andhra Pradesh, Akali Dal in Punjab, National Conference\\nin Jammu and Kashmir , Jharkhand Mukti Morcha in Jharkhand, Asom Gana Parishad in\\nAssam and Nationalist Congress Party and Shiv Sena in Maharashtra. About the regional\\nparties you will read in the following lesson.\\nIntext Questions 19.4\\nFill in the blanks:\\na) National Party should have secured four percent valid votes in at least\\n__________________ states (four/five).\\nb) CPI is a ____________________ party (national/regional).\\nc) DMK is a ____________________ party (national/regional).'),\n",

Indian National Congress\\nAs you have already read, Indian National Congress was formed in the year 1885 in\\nBombay . W.C. Bonnarjee was the first President of the Indian National Congress. To\\nbegin with, Congress was an organisation of middle class intellectuals who were primarily\\nconcerned with political reforms in the British colonial rule. In the twenties under the\\nleadership of Mahatma Gandhi, the Congress became a mass based organisation. The\\nparty started enjoying the support of the common people and played a very significant role\\nin the freedom struggle.\\nAfter independence Jawahar Lal Nehru became the Prime Minsiter and led the Congress\\ntill his death in 1964. As already mentioned in an earlier paragraph, this was known as the\\n‘Nehru era’. The Congress party won first five general elections in 1952, 1957, 1962, 1967\\nand 1971. In 1975 national emergency was declared which went on till 1977. In the elections\\nof 1977, the Congress was defeated. However , in 1980 general elections, the Congress\\nParty led by Indira Gandhi came back to power . Indira Gandhi was assassinated in 1984\\nand during 1985 general elections, Rajiv Gandhi was the leader of the party . Congress\\nwon the 1985 general elections with a lar ger majority . In 1989 though Congress could not\\nget absolute majority , it was the single lar gest party . In the tenth general elections in 1991,\\nCongress again emerged as the single largest party and formed the government at the\\nCentre. In the 1996, general elections Congress could not form government at the Centre.\\nIn the 12th general elections in 1998, Congress could get only 140 Lok Sabha seats. In the\\n1999 general elections Congress’ s strength was further reduced to 1 12. But in the 14th\\ngeneral elections Congress entered into alliance with other secular parties and secured the\\nnumber of seats that provided it an opportunity to form a coalition government.\\nIntext Questions 19.5\\n1. Indian National Congress was formed in the year _________________ (1885/1895/\\n1975).\\n2. Under Mahatama Gandhi’ s leadership Congress became an or ganisation of the\\n___________________ (common people/moderate/rich).\\n3. National emergency was declared in _____________ (1975/1976/1977).\\n2. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)\\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was formed in 1980. Since then it has extended its\\ninfluence in the Hindi belt, Gujarat and Maharashtra. Since 1989, it has been trying to\\nextend its base in South India also.\\nSince its formation in 1980, the BJP has been increasing its number of seats in the Lok\\nSabha gradually . In 1984, general elections it secured only two seats. In 1989 the number\\nof seats increased to 88. In 1991 general elections BJP’ s strength in the Lok Sabha increased\\nto 122 which rose to 161 in the 1996 elections. In 1998 it won 180 seats and in 1999 its'),\n",

In the 1999 general elections, BJP contested as an\\nalliance partner in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). In the recent 2004 general\\nelections BJP  as an alliance of NDA  could not get the required majority . It is playing the\\nrole of the opposition party . The BJP  has emer ged as a significant national party but its\\nsupport base as yet is limited to certain areas, rather than spread all over India.\\n3. The Communist Parties\\nThe two communist parties are the Communist Party of India (CPI) and the Communist\\nParty of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)]. Next to the Congress, the Communist Party is the\\noldest in India. The communist movement began in the early twenties and the Communist\\nParty was founded in 1925. The communists participated in the national movement, though\\noften they had serious differences with the Congress. The communists assert that the\\npeople should be economically equal and the society should not be divided into classes of\\nrich and poor . The workers and peasants and other toiling people who do most of the\\nproductive work for the society , should be given due recognition and power .\\nThe communists were the main opposition in the Lok Sabha throughout the Nehru Era. In\\nthe first Lok Sabha they had 26 members, in the second and the third Lok Sabha, they had\\n27 and 29 members respectively . In 1957, the CPI won absolute majority in the Kerala\\nAssembly and formed the first Communist government in India. In the early sixties specially\\nafter the Chinese aggression of 1962 there were serious differences among the members\\nof the Communist Party . As a result, the party split into two. Those who broke away from\\nCPI, formed CPI(M) in 1964. The CPI(M)’ s main support base has been concentrated in\\nWest Bengal, Kerala and Tripura, though it has registered its presence in Andhra Pradesh,\\nAssam, Bihar , Maharashtra, Orissa and Punjab. The CPI has its pockets of influence in\\nstates like Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar , Manipur , Orissa, Pondicherry , Punjab, etc.\\nMoreover CPI has been a part of the left front coalition in Kerala and West Bengal. In the\\nLok Sabha elections of 2004, both the CPI and the CPI (M) were alliance partners of the\\nCongress. They are supporting the United Progressive Alliance (UP A) government at the\\nCentre from outside.\\n4.  Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP)\\nThe BSP acquired the status of a national party in 1996. The BSP champions the cause of\\nthose sections which belong to low castes, deprived groups and minorities. In fact, these\\nsections of Indian society (the Bahujan Samaj) form the majority of the Indian population.\\nThe BSP believes that this ‘samaj’ should be freed from the exploitation of the upper\\ncastes and by forming their own government. BSP’ s influence lies in states like Madhya\\nPradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. In 1995 and 1997 BSP was a partner in the coalition\\ngovernments in Uttar Pradesh.\\nIntext Questions 19.6\\nFill in the blanks:\\na) In the 1984 general elections BJP secured ____________ seats (2, 3, 4).\\nb) CPI formed its first state government in the state of ___________________ (Kerala,\\nWest Bengal, Andhra Pradesh).\\nc) BSP’ s influence lies in the state of (Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal).'),\n",

By regional party we mean a party which generally operates\\nwithin a limited geographical area and its activities are confined only to a single or handful\\nof states. Further as compared to the broad ranging diverse interests of national parties,\\nthe regional parties represent the interest of a particular area. In simple words, regional\\nparties dif fer from All India parties both in terms of their outlook as well as the interests\\nthey pursue. Their activities are focused on specific issues concerning the region and they\\noperate within the limited area. They merely seek to capture power at the state or regional\\nlevel and do not aspire to control the national government. It is noteworthy that in India,\\nthe number of regional parties is much larger than the national parties and some of the\\nStates are being ruled by the regional parties, viz., Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka,\\nAssam, Jammu & Kashmir etc.\\nObjectives\\nAfter studying this lesson, you will be able to\\n/circle6 analyse the factors responsible for the growth of regionalism;\\n/circle6 determine the factors instrumental for the growth of regional parties;\\n/circle6 create awareness about the role of regional parties;\\n/circle6 distinguish a regional party from a national party .\\n20.1 What is Regionalism\\nThe term ‘regionalism’ has two connotations.

The negative sense regionalism is a great threat to the unity and integrity of\\nthe country . In the Indian context generally the term regionalism has been used in the\\nnegative sense.\\nThe feeling of regionalism may arise either due to the continuous neglect of a particular\\narea or region by the ruling authorities or it may spring up as a result of increasing political\\nawareness of backward people that have been discriminated against. Quite often some\\npolitical leaders encourage the feeling of regionalism to maintain their hold over a particular\\narea or group of people.\\nIntext Questions  20.1\\nFill in the blanks:\\n1.

In India we have ______________ number of regional parties\\n20.2 Different Forms of Regionalism\\nRegionalism in India has assumed various forms like:\\n(a) Demand for  State Autonomy : Regionalism has often led to the demand by states for\\ngreater autonomy from the center . Increasing interference by the Centre in the af fairs of\\nthe states has led to regional feelings. Demand for autonomy has also been raised by\\nregions within some states of the Indian federation.\\n(b) Secession from the Union: This is a dangerous form of regionalism. It emerges\\nwhen states demand separation from the Centre and try to establish an independent identity\\nof their own.\\nDisputes between states over the sharing of river water , primacy given by the states to the\\nlanguage of majority and to people of their own states in job opportunities have also given\\nrise to feelings of regionalism. Migration of people from backward state to a developed\\nstate for employment opportunities have often resulted in a hostile attitude against the\\nmigrants for example, problems going on in Karnataka and A.P.\\n20.3 Development of Regionalism in India\\nRegionalism is not a new phenomenon in the Indian political system. In the pre-independence\\ndays it was promoted by the British imperialists and they deliberately encouraged the\\npeople of various regions to think in terms of their region rather than the nation as a whole,\\nwith a view to maintain their hold over India during the national movement. After\\nIndependence the leaders tried to foster a feeling among the people that they belonged to\\none single nation. The framers of the constitution sought to achieve this by introducing\\nsingle citizenship for all. With the same objective a unified judiciary , all Indian services, and\\na strong Central government was provided. But in view of the vastness of the country and'),\n",

Initially the central leadership felt that regionalism\\nwas a peripheral political factor confined to Tamil Nadu and hence did not pose any threat\\nto national unity . However , that assessment was ill-founded. Soon in Punjab the Akali\\nmovement gained momentum, while in Jammu and Kashmir Sheikh Abdullah revived the\\nNational Conference. During these initial years all the Indian political parties continued to\\nadjust with these regional forces on the plea that they would ultimately succeed in making\\ninroads into the bases of the regional parties and absorb them in their organisations.\\nThe Indian National Congress which enjoyed monopoly of power between 1947–1967\\nand followed a policy of blowing hot and cold toward the regional forces, also contributed\\nto the growth of regionalism in India. It accommodated the regional forces when it was\\nconvenient and raised a hue and cry against them when it was pitted against them. The\\nlocal Congress leaders also encouraged the growth of regionalism and strengthened their\\nhold on local party organisation, with a view to increase their bargaining power with the\\ncentral leaders. In fact a close link developed between central and regional leadership.\\nThis close link between the central and regional leadership greatly encouraged the growth\\nof regionalism.\\nIntext Questions 20.2\\nTrue or False\\n1. Regionalism has often led to the demand by states to greater autonomy from the\\ncenter .    (True/False)\\n2. Disputes regarding sharing water , primacy or language of majorityhave also given\\nrise to feelings of regionalism.    (True/False)\\n20.4 Causes for Growth of Regionalism\\nIn India a number of factors have constituted to the growth of regionalism.\\n1. Regionalism made its appearance as a reaction against the efforts of the national\\ngovernment to impose a particular ideology , language or cultural pattern on all people\\nand groups. Thus the States of South have resisted imposition of Hindi as official\\nlanguage because they feared this would lead to dominance of the North. Similarly ,\\nin Assam anti-foreigner movement was launched by the Assamese to preserve their\\nown culture.\\n2. Continuous neglect of an area or region by the ruling parties and concentration of\\nadministrative and political power has given rise to demand for decentralization of\\nauthority and bifurcate of unilingual states. On occasions sons of soil  theory has\\nbeen put forth to promote the interests of neglected groups or areas of the state.\\n3. The desire of the various units of the Indian federal system to maintain their sub\\ncultural regions and greater degree of self-government has promoted regionalism\\nand given rise to demand for greater autonomy .'),\n",

The desire of regional elites to capture power has also led to rise of regionalism. It is\\nwell known that political parties like DMK, AIADMK, Akali Dal, Telugu Desam\\nAsom Gana Parishad etc., have encouraged regionalism to capture power .\\n5. The interaction between the forces of modernisation and mass participation have\\nalso lar gely contributed to the growth of regionalism in India. As the country is still\\naway from realising the goal of a nation state, the various groups have failed to\\nidentify their group interests with national interests, hence the feeling of regionalism\\nhas persisted.\\n6. The growing awareness among the people of backward areas that they are being\\ndiscriminated against has also promoted feeling of regionalism. The local political\\nleaders have fully exploited this factor and tried to feed the people with the idea that\\nthe Central Government was deliberately trying to maintain regional imbalances by\\nneglecting social and economic development of certain areas.\\n20.5 Role of The Regional Parties\\nThough the regional parties operate within very limited area and pursue only limited objective,\\nthey have played significant role both in the State as well as national politics. The regional\\npolitical parties formed governments in several states and tried to give concrete shape to\\ntheir policies and programmes. Some of the important regional parties which formed\\ngovernments in various states include DMK and AIADMK in Tamil Nadu; National\\nConference in Jammu and Kashmir , Telugu Desam in Andhra Pradesh, Asom Gana Parishad\\nin Assam; Maharasthrawadi Gomantak Party in Goa; Mizo National Front in Mizoram;\\nSikkim Sangram Parishad in Sikkam; All Party Hill Leaders Conference in Meghalaya\\nand Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) in Haryana. Some of the regional parties were also\\npartners in the coalition governments formed in several States after the fourth general\\nelections of 1967. At the Centre also, of late the Regional Parties have been able to play\\ncritical role in helping formation of Congress government. DMK, a regional party , supported\\nMrs. Indira Gandhi’ s government after split in the party in 1969 and enabled her to carry\\non government despite loss of majority in the Parliament. Telugu Desam was the pillar of\\nstrengh for the United Front and later the National Democratic Alliance. The\\nrepresentatives of the regional parties focus the attention of the Parliament on issues in\\ntheir region and try to influence the policies of the Government to promote their own\\ninterests.\\nBut probably the greatest service rendered by the regional political parties is that they\\nhave focused the attention of the people in remote areas on various political and economic\\nissues and contributed to their political awakening. Above all, the regional parties have\\nbeen able to impress on the national political parties that they cannot put up with their\\nattitude of indifference towards regional problems and have compelled them to take keen\\ninterest in the resolution of their problems.\\nIn short it can be said that the regional political parties have not only profoundly influenced\\nthe regional politics but also left tremendous impact o n the national politics.'),\n",

There are certain groups or associations that try to influence the decision-making\\nor policy formulation by the government in accordance with their specific interests. Such\\ngroups are called pressure groups. The government that represents the people carries on\\nadministration in accordance with the public opinion expressed by the people. In fact,\\ndemocracy derives its authority from the people. It seeks people’ s opinion on various\\nissues of common interest. Infact, no government whether it is democratic or not, can\\nafford to ignore the public opinion and pressure groups. Every government respects the\\nfeelings of the public. It is always keen to know their response to various issues that are\\ndirectly or indirectly related to them.

But public exactly does not mean people. There is no single public. In fact,\\nthere are several ‘public’. The total people as a whole do not constitute one single\\nhomogeneous public, having similar views or opinion. The public is not a fixed body of\\nindividuals. The term ‘public’  means a section of society , sharing common interests. It\\nholds similar views and opinions on matters of public concern.\\nIt is therefore, not necessary that public opinion will be the opinion of all the people. It is\\nnot even the opinion of the majority . As there are many publics, there are also dif ferent\\nopinions and different problems. Public opinion necessarily reflects diversity of opinion.\\nIt is also important to understand that public opinion is not the opinion of an individual,\\nthough he or she may be a highly respected person. It is not a private opinion. It is also not\\nan expert opinion, irrespective of the wisdom of the expert. Public opinion is an organised\\nand considered opinion of a section or many sections of the people on any public issue or\\nconcern. It is gen uinely both public and opinion. It is neither a propaganda nor a public\\nrelations exercise.\\nPublic opinion is not the unanimous opinion but the re \\nis a general agreement on the issue. \\nIt may change with the circumstances, time and new \\ninformation. \\nPublic opinion is logical and considered  view of a  section \\nof society. \\nPublic opinion necessarily reflects diversity of op inion. \\nThere is no fixed territory or area for public opin ion. \\nPublic opinion ensures democratic communication.

Public Opinion is the expression of the views of citizens. No\\ngovernment can af ford to ignore it. A sound and ef fective public opinion can even shake\\nthe structures of dictators. The strength of democratic system lies in respecting the mind\\npower of the people. There should be free and fair interaction of thoughts for solving the\\ncollective problems. Public opinion acquires great relevance in realising this democratic\\ngoal. It promotes wider awareness and invites citizens to examine issues from different\\npoints of view . The significance and role of public opinion can be explained as follows:\\n(a) Guide to the Government:  Public opinion acts as the guide to the government in\\nrespect of policy formation. Government functions in general on the basis of mandate\\nreceived in elections and tries to win over the masses to fulfil the promises made during\\nelections.\\n(b) Helping in Law Making:  Government is always under pressure of public opinion\\nand takes note of the same in formulating laws for the common good. Governmental\\npolicies are invariably af fected by people’ s opinion on various issues. Public opinion helps\\nthe government to enact laws in the given situation.\\n(c) Acts as a Watchdog: Public opinion acts as a watchdog. It controls and checks the\\ngovernment from becoming irresponsible. While criticizing the wrong policies of the\\ngovernment, public opinion always keeps the government alert. Government is always\\nconcious of the fact that people would not vote for it or bring it back to power again if it\\ngoes against the wishes of the people.\\n(d) Protects the Rights & Liberties: Public opinion acts as the protector of rights and\\nliberties of citizens. In a democratic country , people have the right to criticize or support\\nthe government in their own way . More ef fective and positive use of this right not only\\nencourages or motivates the government but also keeps the government alive towards the\\nrights and liberties of the people.\\n(e) Acts as a Powerful For ce in International Spher e: - Public opinion has acquired\\nworldwide importance. In fact, international relations are influenced by public opinion. In\\nthe age of globalization, the issues like promotion and protection of human rights, environment\\nand discrimination based on race, religion or sex, prevention of child labour , terrorism etc.\\nhold international community answerable to public opinion. Therefore, the governments\\nremain conscious of such international public opinio n also. Infact, no democratic government\\ncan afford to ignore public opinion.'),\n",

There are\\ninformal and formal processes that mould public opinion.\\n23.3.1 Political Socialisation\\nPolitical socialistion is the basic process through which every indivitual is oriented with\\nrespect to political issues. A human being lives and grows in family , neighbourhood, friends,\\nthe locality and the region. The orientation of attitudes, beliefs and values towards the\\npolitical system acquire shape in association of their groups. The most influencial in\\npersonality formation and character building are the family and the peer group. They\\nprovide the basic mould in influencing the ideas and opinions of the individual.

People express their\\ncriticism or support in the form of articles, or comments through press. Hence, make the\\ngovernment responsible and answerable.In fact, government also propagates its policies\\nand programmes through media. It tries to highlight its achievements to make public opinion\\nin its favour .\\n21.3.3 Radio and Television\\nElectronic media i.e. radio and television act as a mirror of social life. Print media influences\\nonly the educated. The electronic media plays an important part in collecting the information\\nand moulding the thoughts of the uneducated masses also.The audio-visual media is used\\nas a powerful means for bringing about social transformation and setting up a new social\\norder free from social evils. It is used to educate the masses on certain sensitive issues\\nlike casteism, communalism violence etc. Through radio and television masses communicate\\ntheir feelings and opinions towards various government policies and programmes.\\n21.3.4 Cinema\\nCinema has been the traditional medium of entertainment and awareness. The cinema\\ncaters to the artistic and intellectual needs of the people. It cultivates new ideas and norms\\nin the society on political and social problems. Feature films and documentary films have\\ntheir natural impact on the thinking of the people.

They address the public issues and are\\nable to gather huge crowd through lectures, seminars, symposia, workshops and conferences.\\nThey try to establish personal and emotional bond with the public and motivate them\\ntowards positive and healthy steps.\\n21.3.6 Political parties and their activities\\nPolitical parties formulate and organize public opinion. They are called mobilisers of opinion.\\nPolitical parties not only make the people aware of various public issues. Their purpose is\\nto make the people politically conscious to think about public problems.

It is believed that the public takes\\ninterest in local and national affairs. The public is reasonably well informed. The public\\nthinks, with reason and logic and arrives at the rational conclusion. The opinion of the\\npublic is expressed through the elections/polls.

They do not take interest in public affairs. Generally they think that their\\ninvolvement in political decision making is not required. There is a need to change the\\nindifferent attitude and adopt participatory approach. People should be motivated to take\\ninterest in the af fairs of their own country . People have to be sensitized towards important\\nissues related to unity , integrity and development of the nation.\\n(b) Illiteracy: Educated and enlightened people are expected to be good voters and citizens.\\nIlliterate people on the other hand, have a limited knowledge and they do not understand\\nthe political problems. They are not capable of forming an intelligent and rational opinion\\nand are guided by passion and sentiments. Ignorance born of illiteracy is a curse for social\\nlife. A sound public opinion can be formulated only in the environment of knowledge and\\neducation.\\n(c) Poverty:  The poor are always isolated from politics. They do not find time to devote\\ntheir attention to public affairs. They get easily influenced by the tall talks of the political\\nleaders and cast or even sell their votes. The government, non-governmental organisation\\nand pressure groups have to play their effective role. The wide gap between the rich and\\nthe poor has to be minimized and the distribution of wealth must be equitable. Sound and\\nhealthy public opinion is possible only by alleviating poverty .\\n(d) Disharmony amongst various castes and communities: The people and political\\nparties, in democracy have to rise above the feelings and emotions of casteism and\\ncommunalism. They should not divide themselves into narrow walls of religion and sect.\\nReligion and politics should be kept separate. Social harmony in the country would provide\\na better platform for sound and healthy public opinion.\\n(e) Free Press: Unbiased, objective and independent press and fearless media play a\\nvery significant role in the formation of healthy opinion. Press should not be influenced by\\nreligious capitalist or regional interests. Free press should present the authentic and impartial\\nreport.\\nIntext Questions 21.4\\nFill in the blanks :\\n(a)  For sound public opinion, the press has to be ______________ (partial/impartial)\\nand ____________.

Besides political parties, there are some voluntary groups that exist to protect the\\nspecial interest of the individuals in the society .\\nPressure or interest groups are organized groups, having common and social interests,\\nconcerned with influencing decision making by putting pressure from outside. Pressure\\ngroups have voluntary membership and are found in every country .\\nThese pressure groups have a limited and narrow focused issue. They have an informal,\\nclosed and unrecognized character . They , unlike political parties, do not contest elections.\\nThey put pressure on the government through various techniques so are called pressure\\ngroups. Despite this, they play an important role in the politics of the country . The pressure\\ngroups contribute to the political activities of the political parties and help in mobilizing the\\npublic opinion.\\nDifferent types of party systems give rise to different forms of pressure group activities.\\nThe method and style of work of the pressure groups vary in different political systems. It\\nis controlled mainly by five factors: –\\n(i) the pattern of political institutions,\\n(ii) the nature of party system,\\n(iii) the political culture and attitudes of leaders and people,\\n(iv) the nature of the issues and problems confronted and\\n(v) the character and type of the concerned interest groups.\\nIntext Questions 21.5\\nFill in the blanks :\\n(a)  Pressure groups are called pressure groups because they put ___________on the\\ngovernment.

They influence decision making to serve their own interests. Broadly they can\\nbe put into four categories according to their aims and objectives which are given below :\\nProfession Socio-Cultural\\nPressure Pressure\\nGroups Groups\\nInstitutional Pressure\\nPressure Groups\\nGroup Ad-hoc\\n(a) Professional Pressure Groups: -  This category includes the pressure groups that\\nare formed by the employees of a particular occupation or profession for the protection of\\ntheir interests. The big business houses with their vast outlay of resources, availability of\\ntechnical and managerial personnel and due to close links elite groups in government,\\nmedia, administration and opposition parties have always had the most organized and\\npowerful pressure groups at their command.\\nFederation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry\\nSeveral big business houses have a powerful lobby in the parliament and in the legislature.\\nThey also have representatives and Public Relations Officers who keep in touch with\\nadministration and top bureaucracy . The lar gest and the most influencial or ganization of\\nprivate capital in India is the FICCI. It represents more than 40,000 firms. It has a large\\nbusiness corporate world with it. The political parties are dependent on it for funds. In turn\\nthey serve their interests in giving them the concession in the form of trade, tariff, investment\\ntax etc. In the contemporary scenario of globalisation and liberalization, the role of FICCI\\nis all the more important. The government seeks the suggestions and advice of this group\\nparticularly on major policy issues of economical and commercial nature.\\nThe other known business groups like ASSOCHAM i.e. Associated Chambers of\\nCommerce, Confederation of Indian Industries.(CII) the Tatas, Birlas, DCM, Dalmia and\\nHindustan Lever etc. They all try to influence the industrial policies and laws of the\\ngovernment.\\n'),\n",

All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) was formed in 1920 with the\\nobjective to promote socio economic interests of the working class. Hind Mazdoor Sangh,\\nCentre of India Trade unions (CITU) are the examples of these types of Trade Unions.\\nThe other trade unions in other parts of the country in electricity , water , banks, insurance\\netc. are somewhat af filiated to the All India or ganisations.\\nIt has been observed that political parties have been exploiting the farmers and the peasants\\nfor their own interests. So there was a call for them to unite to get their interests fulfilled.\\nThey all want their interest in the field of agriculture should be duly protected. Their chief\\nobjectives include getting higher prices for agriculture products, subsidy for fertilizers\\navailability of loans and manures etc. Farmer ’s organizations like Bhartiya Kisan Union in\\nHaryana, U.P . and Punjab, Karnataka Rajya Sabha etc. influence the decisions of the\\ngovernment in the agricultural field. They also contribute to the sharpening of national\\nawareness and class- consciousness. They do not have the money power of the capital\\nbut have the will and solidarity to work for the upliftment of the downdrodden.\\nIn the educational field also the students, the teachers, non-vocational staff (school, college,\\nuniversity) have their unions to mobilize the public opinion and also to influence the\\ngovernment for their protection of their interests like, P .F., Gratuity , Bonus, L TC Facility ,\\nLeaves opening of more professional institutions, adequate transporation facilities, fee\\nstructure etc. e.g. National S tudents Union of India, Bhartiya Janata Yuva Morcha, All\\nIndia Teachers Association, All India S tudents Union, Delhi University S tudents Union\\netc.\\n(b) Socio Cultural Pressure Groups: There are various kinds of socio cultural pressure\\ngroups which are concerned with community service and the promotion of the interests of\\nthe whole community . Also there are a few for the promotion of their language and religion.\\nExamples are given below:\\nArya Pratinidhi Sabha, Jan Sewa Sangh, Rama Krishna Mission, Arya Samaj, Jamat-I-\\nIslami, Rashtriya Sawayam Sewak Sangh, Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Shiromani Gurudwara\\nPrabandhak Committee, Parsee Anymans, Young Men Christian Association, Bajrang Dal,\\nSanskrit Sahitya Academy , Panjabi Academy , Marathi Sangh, Bhartiya Adim Jati Sangh,\\nSernarthi of People Society .\\n(c) Institutional Pressure Groups: There are certain pressure groups that are working\\nwithin the governmental machinery itself. They influence the government policies in their\\nfavour without directly getting involved in the political system. The pressure groups like\\nCivil Services Association, Police Welfare or ganization, Gazetted Of ficers Union, Defence\\nPersonnel Association, Army Of ficers or ganizations Red Cross Society etc. all came under\\nthis category . The decision on matters such as transfers-leave rules, adequate D.A. due to\\ninflation, allocation of duties etc. are influenced by these pressure groups. Although their\\nactivities are public, they remain very active within the system.'),\n",

Once the\\npurpose is served, they cease to exist. In case of any ur gency , natural calamity or adversity ,\\nthese pressure groups pressurize or influence the government policies in their interest. The\\npressure group like Orissa Relief Or ganisation, Bhoodan Anuyojna, Kaveri Water\\nDistribution Association, Gujrat Relief Association etc.\\n21.7 Role of Pressure Groups\\nPressure group activity has been referred to as ‘Lobby’. Lobby is originally an American\\nterm, but now used not only in European democracies but also in Japan and other parts of\\nthe world as well. It refers to lobbies in Parliament where the MPs or Legislators meet\\nand discuss matters in relation to the business of the house.\\nPressure Groups play a very important role in the Indian political system. They act as a\\nlink and source of communication between the masses and the political parties. They\\nsensitize the public towards various socio economic issues thereby educating them politically .\\nThey produce very effective leadership and also as a training platform for future political\\nleaders. It also bridges the gap between various traditional values in the society . Establishment\\nof unity and integrity are the key results of the pressure groups. Therefore it is very clear\\nthat pressure groups influence both the government and the administrative policies. You\\nhave already learnt earlier about various pressure groups working in India.\\nPolitical institutions of a country determine the activities of pressure groups and their main\\ntargets. In U.K., U.S.A. France and other democracies, the pressure groups have more\\nopportunities of influencing the governmental decisions. In Britain, since the cabinet and\\nthe civil services are more effective, rather than MPs, it is more useful to get access to the\\nformer rather than the latter . It is more profitable to cultivate members of the cabinet and\\ncivil service than lobby in the House of Commons.

Those who fan this religious violence do not consider religion as a moral order\\nbut use it as a means and weapon to pursue their political ambitions. Communalism essentially\\nleads to violence as it is based on mutual religious hatred. This phenomenon leads to\\ndistinction between a communal organisation and a religious organisation. Communalism\\nessentially has following main features.\\n1) It is based on orthodoxy .\\n2) It is exclusive in out look, a communalist considers his own religion to be superior to\\nother religions.\\n3) It is based on intolerance.\\n4) It also propagates intense dislike of other religions.\\n5) It stands for elimination of other religions and its values.\\n6) It adopts extremist tactics including use of violence against other people.\\n22.2 Impact of Communalism\\nCommunalism has divided our society for long. It causes belief in orthodox tenets and\\nprinciples, intolerance hatred of other religions and religious group, distortion of historical\\nfacts and communal violence.\\n22.2.1 Communal Violence\\nMost communal riots prior to 1947 were rooted in the ‘divide and rule’ policy of the British\\ncolonial rule. But after the partition of the country , sections of the Indian elite from both\\nthe communities are also to be blamed for the problem. Communal violence in independent\\nIndia has been caused by many factors. Some general factors are : First the class divisions\\nof our society and the backwardness of our economy has resulted in uneven development\\nof the economy . It is the upper classes of the less-developed communities that have enjoyed\\nthe fruits of limited growth and hence it is they who have also enjoyed political power .\\nOver a period of time some sections among this elite developed a sense of rivalry vis-à-vis\\ntheir counterparts in other communities. In order to draw support from the masses of their\\nown community , these leaders have often encouraged communal feelings to strengthen\\ntheir political support. Thus, the traditional beliefs of the society are perpetuated to the\\nadvantage of the elites. When they , many among common people, feel insecure because\\nof some adverse circumstances, they often tend to rely on religion, which make them\\nvulnerable to political manipulation to inflame communal passions, some times leading to\\nviolence.\\nCommunal violence also increases because communal parties carry on religious propaganda\\nin an of fensive manner , thereby creating ill-will among the members of the various\\ncommunities. The political parties in India which adopt a communal attitude should be\\nblamed for encouraging communal feelings which often cause communal violence.\\nApart from these general factors, some specific local causes also account for communal\\nviolence in India. First, because the power of smugglers and criminal gangs, local rivalries'),\n",

Large cities are\\nalso prone to periodic communal riots because of the power of smugglers and criminal\\ngangs. The communal violence after the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1993 is an\\nexample. Secondly , communal riots occur in towns which have a history of communal\\nriots. Aligarh and Hydrabad, among other cities, suf fer from this trend. Presence of a\\nlarge proportion of religious minorities increases political rivalry between the upper strata\\nof both these communities who often appeal to their communal identity to gain support.\\nWhatever may be the cause of communal violence, whenever it occurs, it immediately\\nattracts attention of the nation. In our society class identities still remain submerged under\\ncaste and communal identities. With economic problems becoming important, the ruling\\nelite of our country manages to convert economic problems like poverty unemployment,\\nprice rise etc. into caste and communal ones. People should be careful not to be influenced\\nby such tactics. Economic problems of the people, like-poverty  and unemployment must\\nbe resolved in the country before the problem of communal violence can be totally eliminated.\\nIntext Questions 22.1\\n1.

Economic problems of common people are solved through communalism.\\n( True/False )\\n22.3 Role of Caste in Indian Society\\nThe political process of any society is influenced by the nature of the society . To understand\\nthe nature of the society we study its social structure. India’ s social structure is best\\nunderstood in terms of caste system  wherein the cast is hierarchically arranged. Over  the\\nyears, the caste system developed into an elaborate system to maintain socio-economic\\ninequalities in the society . Individuals born in and belonging to the lower castes and the\\nout-castes suffered from many disadvantages and were oppressed and exploited by the\\nupper castes. The conditions of the outcastis (Dalits) was particularly pathetic. The practice\\nof untouchability epitomized their conditions.\\n1. In the typical Varna-V yvastha there are four Varnas: Brahmin (the priest and the\\nintellectual class), Kshatriya (warrior and the ruling class), Vaisyas (the producing class -\\npeasants and artisaas) and Shudra (those who performed menial and ‘polluting’ jobs.\\nOne must note here that the ‘varna-vyvastha’ provides more the theory than the actuality\\nof the caste. In reality , there are not four but thousands of castes and jatis, in which the\\ncaste system is organized. It is possible, nevertheless to classify most of the jatis in'),\n",

In other words, Varna system is related\\nto jati in that it gives a holistic frame-work to which any jati will fit.\\n2. Caste is a localized group having a traditional association with an occupation. The\\nprinciple of birth forms the exclusive basis of membership in a caste group. Accordingly ,\\nthe choice of occupation is not open but is determined on the basis of one’ s birth in a caste.\\nIn addition caste groups have rules governing food and marriage. The group defines rules\\nof behaviour for its members and exercise some degree of authority over them including\\nthe right to expel those who defy its authority .\\nCaste as group identity , however , got strengthened in the new context of modern ideas and\\ninstitutions. This happened because it became one of the bases of political mobilization\\namong the many castes and classes before, during the freedom struggle and afterwords.\\nThe socio-religious movements of the 19th century had made the lower castes conscious\\nof their backward conditions and also of their rights that had been denied to them over the\\ncenturies. As a result, many amongst them were no longer prepared to accept their inferior\\nstatus as divinely ordained. In the backdrop of this awakening, the introduction of democratic\\nprinciple of governance, the emergence of party-centered politics and the attempt of the\\nBritish rulers to mobilize the lower and the out-castes along with the Muslims in its support\\nto thwart the growing national movement — all combined to prepare the ground for the\\npoliticization of the castes.\\nBy the time India gained Independence, the Backward classes, because of politicization,\\nhad become a force to reckon with. Their claims and demands could no longer be ignored.\\nAt the same time the nationalist leaders were also committed to the task of improving their\\nconditions.\\nIn light of the above, the constitution makers enjoined upon the new state to take positive\\nmeasures for bringing the backward classes at par with the rest of the society . They\\nrealized that without the positive intervention by the state it would not be possible to remove\\ntheir historically accumulated backwardness. The policy of reservation for the backward\\nclasses needs to be understood in this context. Backward classes refer to three categories\\nof the people — the scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and the other backward classes\\n(OBC).\\nIntext Questions 22.2\\nFill in the blanks :\\n1) …………… are at the base of India’ s social structure.\\n2) In the caste system, castes are __________________ arranged.\\n3) The caste system also known as _____________________ was based on the\\n__________________ division of labor .\\n4) In the caste system, the choice of occupation is not ____________ but is determined\\non the basis of one’ s __________________.'),\n",

The fact that it existed as easily identifiable social cluster of people made it an\\neasy object of political mobilization by political parties in their quest for political support\\nand votes. While the political parties sought to exploit caste for its own electoral purposes,\\ncaste groups by making politics their sphere of activity got a chance to assert their identity\\nand bar gain for benefits and position in society . Thus, caste and politics interaction has\\nbeen a two-way process.\\nIn politicizing the castes, the caste associations played a crucial role. Caste associations\\nwere quasi-voluntary associations in the sense that its membership was open only to the\\nindividuals of the caste community . These associations were formed to secure economic\\nbenefits or educational openings or for more clearly political purpose of uniting to fight the\\nhegemony of the upper castes. In either case, involvement in politics was considered\\nnecessary for securing the specific purpose for which they were formed. Thus, once\\nformed on the basis of caste identity , caste associations went on to acquire non-caste\\nfunctions.\\nIn electoral politics the role of the caste in politics has become powerful. This can be seen\\nat all levels of the political process of the country . All political parties tend to give party\\nticket to candidates for contesting elections from amongst the numerically or otherwise\\ndominant caste in every constituency . Major caste groups get representation in the council\\nof ministers. Be it elections, political appointments or even formation of political parties,\\ncaste has been the major consideration.\\nThe influence of caste, however , varies depending upon the level of election and the\\nregion. Its influence is far more at the local and state-level political process than at the\\nnational level. Caste plays greater role in the rural than in urban areas. In the rural areas\\nand at the local level, the smallness of consituency and the fact that there is greater face\\nto face interactions account for the strong influence of caste in politics.\\nSince independence two factors have especially brought the issue of caste in Indian politics\\ninto sharp focus. These are (1) the introduction of universal adult franchise and (2) the\\nconstitutional provisions for protective discrimination in favour of the backward classes.\\nThe introduction of universal adult franchise brought a very large section of the populace,\\nwho had been hitherto excluded on account of property qualification to vote, into the arena\\nof electoral politics. This made the task of mobilizing votes enormously difficult for the\\npolitical parties. The daunting task was, however , made easy when political parties relied\\nupon castes to get their votes. In the process castes’ involvement in politics deepened with\\nevery election in India.\\nIn addition to the enlarged arena of electoral politics, the constitutional provisions for\\nprotective discrimination also provided the ground for castes to play a significant role in\\npolitics.\\nOne may note here that protective discrimination was meant for three categories of people\\n– the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes and the OBC — collectively called as the\\nbackward classes. Of these three categories, the SCs and ST s were easily identifiable\\nand-there was a large measure of consensus on the need and the desireability of having\\nreservations for them. But the case of the OBCs was different.'),\n",

The first type involved\\nthe caste groups clamouring either for being recognised as OBC by the state governments\\nor those already recognised for getting a higher quota in the reservations. The decision of\\nthe State governments to appoint Backward classes Commission from time to time provided\\nthe occasion for such caste politics to flourish. The second type of caste politics, involved\\nmobilization of social and political forces for and against reservations for the OBC based\\nsolely on caste criteria. The extent of castes involvement in politics can be appreciated by\\nnoting a simple fact that over 50% of the populace belong to the category of the OBCs.\\nWhile the first type of caste politics sought to influence the reservation policy of the state\\ngovernment, the second type of caste politics was aimed to resist the reservation policy of\\nthe central government.\\nThe reservation issue thus, provided a fertile ground for castes to play an active role in\\npolitics.\\n22.5 Reservation Policy\\n22.5.1 Rationale\\nKeeping in mind the backward conditions of the backward classes, the constitution makers\\nalso made special provisions for the upliftment of the backward classes. The special\\nprovisions are in the form of protective discrimination. The policy of reservation is an\\ninstance of protective discrimination. Before we discuss the policy of reservation and its\\nconstitutional provisions, let us briefly look at the constitutional provisions relating to the\\nbackward classes.\\nArticles 38 and 46 in the chapter of Directive principles, enjoin upon the state the duty to\\nstrive for the welfare of the people in general and the backward classes in particular .\\nArticle 38 states: 1) the state shall strive to promote the welfare of the people by securing\\nand promoting as effectively as it may a social order in which Justice — social, economic\\nand political shall form all institutions of national life; 2) the state shall in particular , strive to\\nminimize the inequalities in income, and endeavour to eliminate the inequalities in status,\\nfacilities and opportunities not only amongst individuals but also amongst group of people\\nresiding in different areas and engaged in different vocations.\\nArticle 46 stipulates: “The state shall promote with special care the educational and the\\neconomic interest of the weaker sections of the people and in particular , of the Scheduled\\nCastes and Tribes and shall protect them from injustices and all forms of exploitation.”\\nThe policy of reservation is based on the principle of protective discrimination. Protective\\ndiscrimination in favour of the backward .classes was felt necessary by the constitution\\nmakers because of the realization that equality of opportunity alone would not suffice to\\nbring the backward classes at par with the rest of the society . Equality of opportunity in\\nabsence of equality of conditions would result in deepening of inequality instead of promoting\\nequality . One must note here that the provision of protective discrimination is not an exception\\nto but integral to the Right to Equality .\\n22.5.2 Reservations for  SCs and ST s\\nThe constitution recognizes three categories of people as backward classes. In this section\\nwe will deal with the provisions relating to the SCs and ST s.'),\n",

These are\\n(1) reservation of jobs in government services and in public sector , (2) reservation in\\neducational institutions, and (3) reservations in legislative representations.\\nUnder Articles 16(A), 320(4) and 333, 15% and 7% of the jobs are reserved at all levels in\\nthe public services for the SCs and ST s respectively . This reservation however , must as\\nfar as it may be, consistent with the maintenance of efficiency of the administration (Article\\n35).\\nArticle 15(4) deals with the reservation of seats in the educational institutions. Article\\n15(4) states: “Nothing in Article 15 or clause (2) of Article 29 shall prevent the state from\\nmaking any special provision for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward\\nclasses of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.” Accordingly , the\\nUnion and the State governments have reserved 20% of the seats in all educational\\ninstitutions maintained by public money . Moreover , qualifications for admission have also\\nbeen relaxed for the SCs and ST s so that they can get access to educational opportunities.\\nArticles 330 and 332 provide for reservation of seats in the Lok Sabha and State Legislative\\nAssemblies. 78 seats for the SCs and 38 seats for the ST s are reserved in the Lok Sabha.\\nIn State Legislative Assemblies 540 and 282 seats ar reserved for SCs and ST s respectively .\\nMoreover seats are also reserved in the Panchayati Raj institutions.\\n22.5.3 Reservations for the OBCs\\nAs we have already noted, the task of specifying and identifying other Backwars Classes\\n(OBCS) was left to the union and state government.\\nIn many S tates where the backward classes movement was strong, such as in Tamil\\nNadu, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Gujarat, Bihar , to name a few , the state governments have\\nreserved jobs at all levels in the public services and seats in educational institutions.\\nThe Union government, however , took a very long time in deciding to provide reservation\\nto the OBCs in the central services. The Union government had as early as 1953 appointed\\nKalelkar Commission under Article 340. The Commission submitted its report in 1956, but\\nits recommendations were not implemented by the Union government. The second\\nCommission under Article 340 was appointed by the Janta Party Government in 1978.\\nThis Commission known as Mandal Commission submitted its report in 1982. It identified\\n3943 castes as OBC and recommended 27% reservation in government and semi-\\ngovernment jobs and admission to educational institutions.\\nOn 13th August 1990 the Union Government headed by V.P. Singh issued an of fice\\nmemorandum extending reservation to the OBCs on the lines recommended by the Mandal\\nCommission. Soon thereafter , widespread protests were staged. Writ petitions were filed\\nin Supreme Court and many High Courts questioning this measure. The Supreme Court\\nexamined the issue in November 1992 and permitted the Union Government to reserve\\n27% of the jobs for the OBCs subject to the exclusion of the ‘creamy layer ’ among the\\nOBCs. Ramanand Prasad committee was set up by the Union government to identify the\\n“creamy layer”. Once it had done its job, the government executed the order of 13th\\nAugust 1990 in September 1993.\\nThus, we can see that it took nearly forty years for the union government to provide the\\nbenefits of reservations to the OBCs. It also took as much time to accept caste as a valid\\nbasis for the identification of socially and educationally backward classes.'),\n",

But condition of women in\\nIndia is miserable, due to illiteracy , poverty and backward social values. Keeping in view\\nthe prevalent circumstances, reservation for the women was started to emancipate the\\nwomen from the drudgery of household. A debate has been going on to ensure women’ s\\nreservation at every level of representative system of Indian Democracy and even in the\\nstate administrative services. Under the Panchayati Raj system women’ s seats have been\\nreserved at both the Panchayat level, and the block & district levels. Some political parties\\nare also debating the issue of giving at least 30% tickets to women candidates for contesting\\nelections of state legislative assembly and also for the parliamentary elections but women’ s\\nreservation bill is still pending in the parliament.\\nIntext Questions 22.3\\n1.

As per the Supreme Court ______________ is not eligible for OBC reservation.\\nWhat You Have Learnt\\nCommunalism has divided Hindus and Muslism on religions lines and thwarted communal\\nharmony . The British during the colonial rule and the self centred political class promoted\\nreligious extremism. As a result communal violence has disrupted normal life in the country\\npractically . The criminal forces also caught on to this. Minority communalism and majority\\ncommunalism alike are harmful to healthy democracy and economic progress.\\nIn light of the historically accumulated backwardness of the backward classes and the\\nneed to bring them at par with the rest of the society , constitution provided for protective\\ndiscrimination. Protective discrimination is not an exception but integral to the Right to\\nEquality .

We live in the environment and\\nuse the environmental resources like air , land and water to meet our needs. Development\\nalso means meeting the needs of the people. While meeting the ever-growing needs, we\\nput pressure on the environment. When the pressure exceeds the carrying capacity of the\\nenvironment to repair or replace itself, it creates a serious problem of environmental\\ndegradation. If we use any environmental resource such as ground water beyond its limit\\nof replacement, we may lose it forever . Therefore, there is a need to create ‘awareness’\\nabout Environmental protection. While efforts are being made at the national and\\ninternational level to protect our environment, it is also the responsibility of every citizen to\\nuse our environmental resources with care and protect them from degradation. In this\\nlesson we will discuss the meaning and causes of environmental degradation and the\\nimportance of environmental conservation.\\nObjectives\\nAfter studying this lesson, the learner will be able to\\n/circle6 explain the concept of environmental degradation ;\\n/circle6 identify various factors causing environmental degradation ;\\n/circle6 recognize the growing awareness about Environmental degradation ;\\n/circle6 explain the concept of sustainable development ;\\n/circle6 recognize the national and international commitment to the protection of Environment.\\n23.1 Environmental Degradation\\nEnvironment constitutes a very important part of our life. To understand life without studying\\nthe impact of environment is simply impossible. The need to protect environment can be\\nignored only at our peril. We use environmental resources in our day to day life. These\\nresources are renewable and non-renewable. We have to be more cautious in consuming\\nnon-renewable resources like coal and petroleum, which are prone to depletion. All human\\nactivities have an impact on environment. But in the last two centuries or so, the human\\ninfluence on environment has increased manifold due to the rapid population.E'),\n",

These two are the major\\nfactors in reducing the quality of environment and causing its degradation.\\nThe environmental degradation poses a great danger to man's own survival. It should be\\nrealized, sooner than later , that conservation and improvement of the environment are vital\\nfor the survival, and well being of mankind. Natural resources of land, air and water have\\nto be used wisely as a trust to ensure a healthy environment for the present and future\\ngenerations.\\n23.1.1 Envirnomental Problem\\nSome of the notable problem of environment can be identified as under: -\\na. Land Air And Water : pollution of land and water has af fected plants, animals and\\nhuman beings. The quality of soil is deterionating resulting in the loss of agricultural land.\\nThe loss is estimated to be about five to seven million hectares of land each year . Soil\\nerosion, as a result of wind and/or water , costs the world dearly . The recurring floods have\\ntheir own peculiar casualties like deforestation, silt in the river bed, inadequate and improper\\ndrainage, loss of men and property . The vast oceans, after being turned in to dumping\\ngrounds for all nuclear wastes, have poisoned and polluted the whole natural environment.\\nb.Population Growth :  population growth means more people to eat and breathe, and\\nputting an excessive pressure on land and forest, and ultimately disturbing the ecological\\nbalance.\\nOur growing population is putting pressure on land, leading to poor quality of productivity ,\\ndeforestation (the loss of forest land so necessary for ecological balance and exitinction of\\nwild life leading to imbalance in the ecological order , loss of wild life heritage and ultimately\\ndwindling of several species. The growing population is not only a problem for the natural\\nenvironment; it is a problem for any other aspect of environment, say , for example social,\\neconomic, political etc.\\nc. Urbanization :  Urbanization is no less a source of pollution, and therefore, a threat to\\nthe environment. Urbanization means maddening race of people from villages to the cities.\\nThe net result of urbanization is dirt, disease and disasters. In a state of growing urbanization,\\nenvironmental problem like sanitation, ill-heath, housing, water-supply and electricity keep\\nexpanding. On the other , the environmental degradation is caused in the rural life due to\\nindiscriminate collection of firewood, overgrazing and depletion of other natural resources.\\nd. Industrialization :  Industrialization coupled with the development of the means of\\ntransport and communication has not only polluted the environment, but also has led to the\\nshrinking of the natural resources. Both ways, the loss is really heavy . Increasing level of\\nheat fluxes, carbon dioxide and particulate, radioactive nuclear wastes and the like create\\nenvironment hazards. On the other hand, the consumption of conventional source of energy\\nleads to the loss of natural resource. We are building a world without caring for future\\ngenerations.\\nIntext Questions 23.1\\nIdentify The True and False statement\\n1. Coal is a renewable resource.\"),\n",

The fast development in science and technology is a major factor contributing to the\\nenvironmental degradation.\\n3. The growing population in India does not contribute to the environmental degradation.\\n4. Trees are a good example of non-renewable resource.\\n23.2 Awareness about Envir onmental Pr otection\\nIn the past two decades, environment has attracted the attention of decision makers,\\nscientists and even laymen in many parts of the world. They are becoming increasingly\\nconscious of issues such as famines, droughts, floods, scarcity of fuel, firewood and fodder ,\\npollution of air and water , problems of hazardous chemicals and radiation, depletion of\\nnatural resources, extinction of wildlife and dangers to flora and fauna. People are now\\naware of the need to protect the natural environmental resources of air , water , soil and\\nplant life that constitute the natural capital on which man depends.\\nThe environmental issues are important because the absence of their solutions is more\\nhorrible. Unless environmental issues are not solved or not taken care of the coming\\ngenerations may find earth worth not living. The need of the planet and the needs of the\\nperson have become one.\\nThere is no denying the fact that environment has to be protected and conserved so to\\nmake future life possible. Indeed, man\\'s needs are increasing and accordingly the\\nenvironment is also being altered, indeed, nature\\'s capacity is too accommodating and too\\nregenerative yet there is a limit to nature\\'s capacity , especially when pressure of exploding\\npopulation and technology keep mounting. What is required is the sustenance, conservation\\nand improvement of the changing and fragile environment.\\n23.3 The Concept of Sustainable Development\\nThe world commission on environment and development (the Brundtland commission)\\nsubmitted its report entitled “Our common future’ in 1987. This report highlighted and\\npopularised the concept of \\'sustainable development\\'. Sustainable development has been\\ndefined on meeting the needs of the present generation without compromising the need of\\nfuture generations. All developmental activities involve some amount of environmental\\ndegradation. What is required is to take into account the damage to environment as a\\nresult of development, and strike a balance between development and environmental\\nprotection. The aim should be to achieve sustainable levels of people\\'s welfare and\\ndevelopment. The primary concern is how many people can ultimately be supported by\\nenvironment and at what level of quality of life.\\nThe mainstream greens scholars like Carr , Brown, Dala, Schumacher . Does not make\\nsense and others, all lay stress on \"sustainability\" of environment together with development.\\nThe emphasis of the mainstream green\\' are not on pollution, but on (1) energy and its\\nresource may be renewed, and be kept renewing, (2) the waste be changed into\\nraw-material, raw-material into waste, waste into raw- material: recycling of waste into\\nraw-material; (3) gross national product and its growth targets need not be sought, but\\nwhat should be sought is the satisfaction of real human needs\\'. The greens say that growth\\nmeans cancer , a cancer that threatens to spread worldwide, and destroy all life. They'),\n",

They advocate\\nextensive decentralization.\\nThe concept of sustainable development is more about environment and less about\\ndevelopment; more about stability and less about change; more about restricting one's\\nwants and less about the continuing material development more about the non-exploitative\\nattitude towards environment and less about harnessing it; more about small communities\\nand less about the larger ones. It is not a concept of development with environment, but is\\nenvironment without growth.\\nIndeed, ecological degradation should stop. But why should the pace of development stop?\\nA disciplined uses of environmental benefits go a long way for all round development.\\nScholars and activists assert that environmental degradation can be controlled and reversed\\nonly by ensuring that the parties causing the damage should be made accountable for their\\naction and that they should participate in improving environmental conditions. What is\\nneeded is a set of norms, which bring the demands of development and the compulsion of\\nenvironment closer to each other .\\n23.4 National and International Efforts\\nIn India, the environmental awareness gained importance since 1970s after the UN\\nsponsored conference on environment in Stockholm (1972). Indian government took many\\nenvironment friendly activities. Ministry of environment and forest was established and\\nlaws were enacted on environment protection in 1986.\\nThe objective of India's National Environment policy , here, are worth stating.\\n1) Conserve and develop safe, healthy , productive, and aesthetically satisfying\\nenvironment ;\\n2) Upgrade, develop and manage rural and urban settlement to enhance the quality of\\nlife ;\\n3) Plan development on sound ecological principles with environmental impact\\nassessment and incorporating appropriate environmental safeguards ;\\n4) Promote environmental safety-technologies, recycling of resources and utilization of\\nwastes ;\\n5) Conserve the biotic diversity in the country by creating nature reserves and sanctuaries\\nfor specific habitats such as mountains, rain forests, pastures, deserts, wet lands,\\nlakes, beaches, mangroves, estuaries, lagoons and island ;\\n6) Safeguard the environment within the national maritime Exclusive Economic Zone ;\\n7) Evolve environmental norms and establish effective mechanism for monitoring\\nsurveillance and collection and dissemination of information ;\\n8) Preserve science landscapes, as well as historic and cultural monuments and their\\nenvirons ;\\n9) Promote environmental education at all level and create public awareness ;\\n10)  Encourage research in environmental science and technological and social\\ninvestigation to conserve and improve the environment and\"),\n",

The late Prime minister Mrs. Indira Gandhi was the only Head of\\nGovernment, attending the 1972 Stockholm conference, which was called the “U.N.\\nConference on Human environment”. The Rio Conference 20 years later was called\\nthe “U.N. Conference on Environment and Development”. It was Mrs. Gandhi who\\nfirst pointed out that poverty was the greatest polluter and unless it was eliminated\\nthrough national and international efforts it was futile to talk about protecting the\\nplanet from environmental disaster . UNDP , the World Bank and other institutions of\\nthe U.N. system are now advocating the elimination of poverty as the central task in\\nsustainable development. Indeed environmental and development polices are seen as\\ncomplementing each other . The conflicted between the requirement of long-term\\nenvironmental interests and the immediate compulsions of development is certainly\\nto be resolved. But any world order cannot be sustainable if three-fourths of its\\npopulation continues to live in poverty . Environmental rights and developmental rights\\ntogether constitute the democratic and human rights of all the people of the world.\\nThe Mont real convention and the conventions on climate change; bio-diversity and\\nforest adopted at Rio are important landmarks in the world movement for sustainable\\ndevelopment and environmental protection. India has accepted these conventions\\nand is taking systematic measures to implement them. An environmental action\\nprogramme funded by U.N.D.P .is under implementation. There are 31 schemes for\\nindustrial pollution control approved by the World Bank, involving of US. $ 105 million.\\nOn the anvil are common ef fluent plants for small industries located in a cluster , the\\nbig plants being looked after individually . Seventeen grossly polluting industries have\\nbeen identified for en vironment control within a time schedule. For certain categories\\nof industries, prior environment clearance is compulsory before they can be set up. In\\nregard to transport pollution apart from conversation measures, population free engines\\nare being designed, some of which have already been introduced for two-wheelers,\\nthree-wheelers and some of the popular cars. A National Forestry Plan is in progress.\\nEnvironmental Brigades, Afforestation Brigades and Ecological task Force have been\\norganized by Non-government organizations (NGOs.) India's wild life conservation\\nprojects have met with remarkable success. India has a protected network of 75\\nnational parks and 421 wild life sanctuaries. The Tiger project has been a great success.\\nIndia also has an elaborate laws relating to the prevention of pollution of water , soil\\nand air and a system of environmental audit of most industrial projects. While this is\\nvoluntary for most countries, India has a mandatory rule in this regard. India is\\nalso engaged in serious and systematic efforts to develop alternative and renewable\\nsources of ener gy like solar , wind and wave ener gy which are environment friendly .\\nEmphasis is laid on solar energy on whi ch some significant technological progress\\nhas been made. India is taking all these measures partially with international assistance.\"),\n",

What is governance? It has been defined as the use of power and\\nauthority by those in government to provide goods and services to the people to uphold the\\ncommon good and fulfill the aspirations and needs of the common man.

Thus good governance is concerned\\nwith high quality in governance. All sections of the society today judge their government\\nby their governance. Earlier , coercive state was considered to be most ef fective instrument\\nof good governance. In ancient and medieval India a king, though authoritarian, was\\nsupposed to be conscientious and responsive to the needs of the subjects.\\nIn modern times, good governance implies enlightened citizenship as well as accountable\\nand constitutional government. Good governance is also a key developmental concept\\ntoday . The debate only relates to the question of how to bring about development. It is a\\nconcept that is inclusive and positive in nature. It is inclusive in so far as it aims at involvement\\nof people in the process of development. Thus development is not merely people-oriented\\nbut people- centered. It is positive to the extent of building up new levels of skills, knowledge\\nand support for development. Let us now discuss some of the features or characteristics\\nof good governance.\\n24.2 Features of Good Governance\\nThe next important question in the discussion on good governance is: what are the basic\\nfeatures or elements of good governance? A number of, reports and studies have sought\\nto identify a number of features. In the scheme of Kautilya, for instance, the following\\nfeatures formed part of good governance:\\n/circle6 Law and order\\n/circle6 People caring administration\\n/circle6 Justice and rationality as the basis of decision\\n/circle6 Corruption free governance\\nThe World Bank in its reports of 1989 and 1992, the Or ganization for Economic Cooperation\\nand Development (OECD) Commission on Global Governance (1995), United Nations\\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) 1997 have all dealt with the attributes of good\\ngovernance extensively .\\nThese concerns of good governance have been very clearly voiced in Asian Development\\nBasic report in the shape of the following questions :\\n/circle6 Do people fully participate in governance?\\n/circle6 Are people fully informed?\\n/circle6 Do people make decisions or can they at least hold the decision makers accountable?\\n/circle6 Are the women equal partners with men in Governance?\\n/circle6 Are the needs of the poor and disadvantaged met?\\n/circle6 Are peoples’ human rights guaranteed?\\n/circle6 Are the needs of the future generation taken into account in current\\npolicies?\\n/circle6 Do people own their structures of governance?'),\n",

Accountability , in fact, implies that the\\nbureaucracy should be answerable for what they do or don’t do? This is sought to be\\nadministered in a parliamentary system through questions, debates, discussions, budgetary\\napprovals, committees and such other methods by parliament. The executive is to be\\nresponsive to the people through their representatives. It is, however , also true that this\\nmechanism has increasingly proved to be ineffective for reasons of decline in the quality\\nand character of debates and the representatives, transformation of parliamentary system\\ninto a cabinet system of government, criminalization of politics and fragmentation of society\\nand politics. Secondly , accountability is also ensured through judicial review of the\\ngovernmental decisions or laws. The citizens are also seeking judicial intervention through\\nPublic Interest Litigation (PIL) for prompt action on certain issues affecting the common\\nlife. Such practices are in vogue, directly or indirectly in several countries like New Zeeland,\\nCanada, Australia and India. Recently , a more ef fective mode of public accountability is\\nthe system of citizens’  charter . The idea is to change the bureaucratic culture to include\\npeople friendly attitudes instead of patriarchal, indifferent, casual and callous behavior to\\ncitizens. The old feudal value must give place to modern democratic values in bureaucracy .\\nAn accountable system of governance, thus, presupposes the following functional and\\nbehavioral traits of the civil servants:\\n/circle6 Achievement oriented behaviour ,\\n/circle6 Judicious use of authority ,\\n/circle6 Pursuit of happiness of the people,\\n/circle6 Use of reason and experience as the basis of decision,\\n/circle6 Shirking of work to be identified and punished,\\n/circle6 Time bound implementation of Policies and Plans,\\n/circle6 Strength of character , intelligence, perseverance and extensity of civil servants,\\n/circle6 Uprightness, friendliness and firmness of devotion in dealing with others,\\n/circle6 Capacity for doing a work which should be supplemented by the skill-in-action and\\nquestion for perfection.\\nIn every country a number of institutional and legal arrangements have been made to\\nsecure the prevalence of the characteristics of an accountable administration. For example,\\nin India setting up of institutions like Central Vigilance Commission and national commissions\\nfor Women, Schedules Tribes, Schedules Castes, Minorities and Backward Classes, National\\nLabour Commission, National Commissions for Human Rights and Minorities, and\\nComptroller and Auditor General of India are some such ef forts or steps to administer\\nsocial, legal constitutional and systemic commitments in bureaucracy . It seeks to remove\\nthe tendencies of administrative bias, corruption, alienation and secrecy . The aim is to\\nmake administration poor-sensitive, gender-sensitive, and more sensitive to the demands\\nand grievances of the public. The purpose is to prevent undesirable acts or behavior and to\\npromote efficiency and integrity of public servants. The Governments have also initiated a\\nnumber of other measures to see the actual operations of accountability in administration.'),\n",

But how is it that they have not been finding it so easy to provide to all\\ntheir citizens a just, equal and free social order . What are the factors that are blocking the\\nroad to good governance? There are a number of factors responsible for the failure to\\nachieve the desired ends, but the following are the major threats to good governance :\\n(A) Corruption\\n(B) Population Growth\\n(C) Culture of Violence\\n24.3.1 Corruption\\nCorruption is an illegal use of authority for personal gains. Corruption is a universal disease\\ncausing harm to the people and government almost everywhere in the world. However , in\\nthe countries like India it has assumed the shape of a cancer . Since the days of Kautilya\\nthe issue of ethics and integrity in government has been a major concern. At times the\\npolitical leaders have expressed their helplessness to contain corruption by arguing that\\ncorruption is a worldwide phenomenon. But the question of probity and corruption is getting\\na little more attention than earlier . The exposure of the scams and the demand for action\\nagainst the corruption is now increasing. But no step to fight corruption will be effective\\nunless all forms of corruption – political, economic, moral and administrative are fought\\nwith a sense of commitment and will. In order to meet the threat of corruption to good\\ngovernance, the following steps are necessary:\\n1. Breaking the nexus between politicians, bureaucrats and criminals.\\n2. Ensuring a cost-effective administration of justice.\\n3. Setting up of Public interest litigation courts at the national, state and local levels.\\n4. Making right to information more effective.\\n5. Strengthening law enforcement agencies in terms of autonomy , skills, attitudinal change\\nand awareness of the social problems.\\n6. Forfeiture of the properties of the corrupt immediately after the charges are framed.\\nSuch a property can be released only after the person is proved innocent.\\n7. Improving bureaucratic functioning by way of simplification of rules, regulations and\\nprocedures of work.\\n8. Mobilizing the society to support the system of rule of law .\\n9. Putting an end to the system of patronage and nepotism from government organizations.'),\n",

However , one finds\\nthat development ef forts have failed to eliminate poverty , unemployment and illiteracy and\\nto secure to all ‘citizens equitable access to even primary education and health, food,\\nwater and a house. From a population of about 35 crores at the time of India’ s Independence\\nto more than 100 crores now is a cause for concern. Though some states in India such as\\nKerala, TamilNadu, Goa and Manipur have already achieved population stabilisation, there\\nare still some states like Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Bihar which will\\ntake a long time to stabilize their population. The phenomenal growth in numbers requires\\nresources to sustain them. There is an increasing demand on land, air and water resources.\\nProviding adequate educational and health facilities, food, shelter and employment to the\\ngrowing numbers is a difficult task before any government in India. Look at our large\\ncities where concentration of a very large population poses many problems of health and\\nsanitation, water supply , roads, and electricity . In fact, in many respects cities like Mumbai,\\nCalcutta and Delhi are increasingly becoming ungovernable. The rapidly increasing\\npopulation is, in fact, a means to a breakdown of good governance. Population can be\\nstablized through spread of education, awareness, health education, people’ s involvement\\nand development etc.\\n24.3.3 Cultur e of Violence\\nResort to illegal force is considered to be a law and order problem. But when one looks at\\nit from the point of view of the principles of good governance, it becomes clear that peace\\nand order is the first step to development. Strikes, riots, terror attacks onerant of this\\nharmful culture of violence. The government can focus on economic, social and political\\ndevelopment if it is free from the concerns of threat to public safety and security in terms\\nof life and property . Moreover , terrorism is also the greatest threat to the rule of law\\nbecause terror replaces the law or seeks to subvert the law . Terrorism is a hindrance to\\nprogress. No industrialist would be willing to invest in an area, which is affected by violence\\nand terrorist activities. This produces an adverse impact on employment, health, education\\nand the provision of other services to the people in the long run. The social life also comes\\nto a halt and people become almost in house prisoners or suffer from mental agonies of\\ndifferent types if they live under the shadow of violence and terrorism. The issue of\\nhuman rights also comes to the fore. Terrorists seldom respect the human rights of the\\ncomman man. But when the government uses brutal force to contain terrorism, at times\\nhuman rights of common citizens are violated by the state police. It requires a clear vision,\\ncourage and understanding to deal with this menace through dialogue with the violators of\\nlaw, redressal of their genuine grievances, involvement of the neighbours and wider\\ninternational governments in the fight against terrorism.\\nIntext Questions 24.2\\nFill in the blanks :\\n1. Corruption is an ___________ use of authority for personal benefits (legal/ illegal).\\n2. Corruption is concerned with ___________ in public life (secrecy/ probity)'),\n",

Corruption can be reduced by ___________ (simplification/ reviving of Rules and\\nRegulations)\\n4. Population has been stabilized in ___________ (Uttar Pradesh/ Kerala)\\n5. Violence is the greatest threat to ___________ (Rule of Law/ Police).\\n24.4 Measures to Establish Good Governance\\nOne can draw a long list of the measures to realize the goals of good governance. Let us\\ndiscuss two measures viz. ensure people’ s participation and the use of computers and\\ninformation technology , for an ef ficient, ef fective, honest, transparent and law abiding\\nsystem of governance.\\n24.4.1 Peoples Participation for Good Governance\\nPeople’ s participation is given increasing priority in the scheme of governance. It is\\nrecognized that people’ s involvement in decision-making and decision implementation would\\nact as :\\n/circle6 a check on indif ferent and inef ficient bureaucracy . In other words people could act\\nas pressure on administration to act and act in time.\\n/circle6 Instruments for a responsive and accountable administration.\\n/circle6 a medium of development administration and self-government.\\n/circle6 a mobiliser and user of local resources for local development.\\nThe people can perform this role either by becoming a member of any social organization\\nor interest and pressure groups or welfare organization or a political party or by becoming\\na part of bureaucracy and government at national, regional or local levels. The governments\\nare seeking to involve people by the democratic decentralization-the panchayats and\\nmunicipalities or by association in advisory or consultative committees and institutions.\\nPeople also organize themselves to demand a policy to meet the expectations of the citizens.\\nThey organize as groups to support a people friendly decision of the government as they\\nalso oppose anti people measures taken by it. One can mention the name of organizations\\nlike: Narmada Bachao Andolan, Bachpan Bachao Andolan, Peoples’  Initiative, Help Age\\nIndia, Common Cause Shiksha Bachao Andolan etc. in this context. People, thus, can play\\na significant role as opinion makers both in favour and against the government and\\nadministration. At times, individuals tend to work for the resolution of conflicts within the\\nsociety or between the society and the state. Individuals can also act as a link between the\\npeople and the bureaucracy by supplying the information about the action / reaction of the\\npeople and their roles. By such feedback the civil servants can remedy the situation. Since\\nthe levels of education, information, knowledge of the government, political and the economic\\nstatus condition people’ s participation, a lar ge number of local people remain outside the\\nsystem of governance. Therefore, our country has made deliberate attempt to include the\\npoorer sections in the process of decision-making and development. Reservation of 33.3%\\nseats for women in the panchayati raj and the urban local government is one such step.\\nThere is a provision for reservation of seats for SCs/ST s in the proportion to their population\\nin the areas of local government. For instance, if there are 20% Scheduled Castes in a\\ndistrict then 20% seats shall be reserved for them in the Zila parishad. Similarly , if the'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Hp\\\\Documents\\\\vscode\\\\prepbridge\\\\prepbridge\\\\data\\\\indian-polity.pdf', 'page': 265}, page_content='MODULE - 5\\nNotes\\n264Political Science\\nMajor Contemporary\\nIssuesnumber of Scheduled tribes in 1% in a village than 1% seats shall be reserved for the\\nScheduled Tribes in the Gram Panchayat. Reservation for the backward classes has been\\nleft to the state government. It may not be wrong, however , to state that there is still a gap\\nbetween what is provided and what is implemented in the area of the people’ s participation\\nin governance, especially in the local governments. It is only a handful of people who\\nappear to be empowered.\\n24.5 Role of Computer  and Information Technology (IT) as\\nmeans of good governance\\nFrom the discussion held so far you must have noted that the essence of good governance\\nis being people-friendly and power-sharing system on the one hand and being responsive,\\naccessible, moral, transparent and corruption free system on the other . The use of computers\\nand information technology is visualized as a very effective tool of good governance. It\\nseeks to improve.\\n/circle6 Delivery of services to the people at low cost.\\n/circle6 Empowerment of people through dissemination of information.\\n/circle6 Openness and transparency in the working of government.\\n/circle6 Innovations and introduction of new ideas and concepts in the performance by the\\ngovernment and the people.\\n/circle6 Effective linkages between citizens and the administration\\n/circle6 Comprehensive monitoring and assessment of the performance of the government.\\nComputers, thus, can increase people’ s reach to the information relating to rules, regulations\\nor procedures or about the welfare and development scheme of the government or about\\nthe welfare and development scheme of the government or information about weather\\nand climate that can be used by farmers and citizens. It is said corruption is the product of\\nface-to-face meeting between the giver and receiver of a decision. Computers can reduce\\ntheir personal contacts to curb corruption. For example, a farmer can get his land record\\ncopy on the computer , a citizen can pay any bill or tax without actually going to the cash\\ncounter and suf fering the agony of long queue or losing the earnings of the day . The\\nGyandoot programme being implemented in Dhar district of Madhya Pradesh in India\\nprovides the number of services like online registration, copies of land record, agriculture\\nproduce auction center to the people at a nominal price. The list may further include\\nfacilities like eligibility rules and application for loans; prices of seeds, fertilizers and tools,\\nthe power cut schedule, availability of diesel etc. Such a system would cut the administrative\\ndelays, which is another source of corruption. It would reduce time and financial cost of\\nthe facility as the citizens would get them through computer at their doorsteps. The\\ngovernment of Karnataka is using computers for transparency in educational admission\\nand recruitment, transfers and payment of salaries of teachers. Computers are also used\\nto know the implementation of the instructions or orders of the chief minister . It is also\\nbeing used for the management of the constituency and prepare summarized data on\\nmajor projects in health, housing and other social welfare schemes.\\nIn Kerala a computerized project known as FRIENDS (Fast, Reliable, Instant, Efficient\\nNetwork for disbursement of services) is working to provide a range of public services'),\n",

The purpose of any law dealing with these rights is merely to recognize them, to\\nregulate their exercise and to provide for their enforcement, and the related matters.\\nInviolability of some basic rights in a civilized society is based on this premise. Human\\nrights are considered to be universal, indivisible and interdependent.\\n‘Human rights’ in practice have been defined to include all aspects of dignified human\\nexistence which make every human being an equal member of the human family . Human\\ndignity is the essence of human rights. It is the wide understanding of this aspect and\\nappreciation of the range of dignity of the individual which defines the true scope of\\nhuman rights.\\n Objectives\\nAfter studing this lesson, you will be able to\\n/circle6 Explain the basic concept of human rights ;\\n/circle6 Classify the main categories of human rights ;\\n/circle6 Recall the major landmarks in the development of human rights ;\\n/circle6 Trace the evolution of human rights in India ;\\n/circle6 Recognize the role of non-governmental organizations in the promotion and protecton\\nof human rights.\\n25.1 Basic Concept of Human Rights\\nThere have been a number of ways of classifying human rights. Some of the categories\\nare given below :\\n25.1.1 Classical\\nThese have been defined to include civil and political rights and generally restrict the\\npowers of the state in respect of actions affecting the individual.T'),\n",

Consequently , the term fundamental rights tends to be\\nused to indicate more importance of certain rights. Some rights are so important that they\\nmust always be given precedence in national and international policy . They include all the\\nrights pertaining to individual dignity as well as to their material needs.\\n25.1.3 Collective and Individual Rights\\nIn general, most human rights relate to the individual. It will, however , become apparent\\nthat some of them can only be exercised by groups. This is especially so when the ability\\nto exercise rights is linked to membership of a particular group.\\n25.1.4 First, Second and Third Generation Rights\\nClearly , this classification follows the historical development of rights. First are the civil\\nand political rights and second are the social, economic and cultural ones. In recent years,\\nacademics have started to talk about the existence of a third generation of rights which\\nare solidarity rights, for example the right to peace, the right to development, the right to\\nfood and to a clean environment. Human rights are necessarily dynamic.\\n25.2 Six Features of Human Rights\\nFrom the above discussion we can conclude that there are certain common features of all\\nthe categories of human rights. We can identify at least six features which are basic to the\\nconcept of human rights.\\n25.2.1 People have rights simply because they are human\\nAll people have the right to lead a dignified and human life, and work towards achieving\\nthis for all people. These rights cannot be denied on the basis of caste, colour , religion and\\ngender .\\n25.2.2 Human rights are universal\\nThey take no account of nation, race, sex or colour . People of all nations, colour , race,\\nreligion have same rights everywhere. The developed and developing countries in all\\ncontinents of the world must guarantee same rights to all their citizens.\\n25.2.3 Human rights treat all people as equal\\nThis follows the idea that “all human beings are born free and equal in rights and dignity”\\nand therefore deserve the same opportunities and treatment, whilst simultaneously respecting\\ntheir dif ferent cultures and traditions, political persuasion, sexuality , social origin, status\\netc. Governments must therefore work to create the same opportunities for all the people\\nin the country and this may involve extra work to make those opportunities the same for\\ncertain sections in society e.g. women, children, and the disabled.\\n25.2.4 These rights belong primarily to individuals\\nThis means that they are concerned with the relationship between an individual and the\\nstate.

Over the\\nnext few centuries, the idea of liberty gradually separated from status and was viewed as\\na right pertaining to all human beings.\\nThis was also the time when the British colonies in North America strove for independence\\nand drew up their own Declaration of Independence  in 1776, based on the idea of'),\n",

The linkage between the two is direct and clear .\\nThe nature and extent of S tate’s responsibility for the protection of human rights was\\nindicated by the NHRC in its orders made in the case of recent Gujarat communal\\ndisturbances. The Commission observed :\\n“It is the primary and inescapable responsibility of the State to protect the right to life,\\nliberty , equality and dignity of all of those who constitute it. It is also the responsibility of\\nthe State to ensure that such rights are not violated either through overt acts, or through\\nabetment or negligence. It is a clear and emerging principle of human rights jurisprudence\\nthat the State is responsible not only for the acts of its own agents, but also for the acts of\\nnon-State players acting within its jurisdiction. The State is, in addition, responsible for any\\ninaction that may cause or facilitate the violation of human rights”.\\nThe National Commission on Human Rights has investigated several cases of gross violation\\nof human rights by official agencies and also terrorist groups. The commission while inquiring\\ninto the complaint of the violation of human rights may call for information or report from\\nthe Central Government or any State Government or any other authority or organisation\\nsubordinate there to, within such time as may be specified by it. When after the inquiry the\\nCommission comes to the conclusion that violation of human rights has occurred, it may\\ntake the following steps :\\n1. where the inquiry discloses that violation of human rights or negligence in the prevention\\nof human rights by a public servant, it may recommend to initiate proceedings for\\nprosecution by the concerned government or authority .\\n2. approach the Supreme Court or the High Court concerned for directions.\\n3. recommend to the concerned government or authority for the grant of immediate\\ninterim relief to the victim or the members of his family .\\nWhenever a complaint of violation of human rights is made against a member of the\\nArmed Forces the commission is required to follow a different procedure, It may seek a\\nreport from the Central government and may make its recommendations.The Commission\\ntook notice of reports dated 22 March 2000, which appeared in all leading newspapers,\\nconcerning the killing of 35 members of the Sikh community in a village of Anantnag\\nDistrict during the night of 21 March 2000 by armed militants. It was stated that all those\\nkilled were men, aged between 16 and 55. Later , a woman died of shock on seeing the\\nbodies of those killed. At least two families lost all of their male members. The incident\\noccurred a few hours before the President of the United S tates of America was to begin\\nan official tour to India. The Commission issued notice to the Chief Secretary and Director\\nGeneral of Police, Government of J&K as well as to the Secretary , Ministry of Home\\nAffairs, Government of India calling for detailed reports.\\nOn 15 April 1996 six naxalites were killed by the police at Murumdag village, Daltonganj,\\nBihar . The Peoples Union for Civil Liberties at Palamau which had earlier enquired into'),\n",

On receipt of\\ninformation: the police came and encircled the members of the armed group who\\nsurrendered to the police. Thereafter , the members of the group were made to stand at\\ndifferent places and fired at by the police. In all six persons were killed as a result of the\\nfiring by the police. The PUCL found that the allegation of the police that the naxalite\\ngroup had attacked the police party with bombs and firearms and that the police returned\\nfire in self-defence resulting in the death of six persons to be untrue. The armed group\\ncame in plain clothes but after their post mortem they were dressed in khaki uniforms\\nwhich had neither any holes nor bullet marks on them. The dead bodies were thrown away\\nbut when there was a protest by the people, six bodies were transported in a police van\\nand cremated by the police.As the police attached to the same police station were involved\\nin the firing resulting in the killing, the Commission recommended that the case should be\\nmade to an independent investigation agency , namely , CID and to complete the investigation\\nwithin four months. If the investigation called for launching of prosecution, steps for speedy\\ntrial be taken. The Commission expressed the hope that compensation would be awarded\\nby the State if the case ended in conviction.\\nThe Commission took notice of a matter reported in the newspaper ‘Indian Express’ dated\\n27 January 1999 captioned “Bihar: old script, new victims, and upper caste Ranbir Sena\\nkills 21 Dalits in Jehanabad”. According to the report, the Ranbir Sena, a private army of\\nupper caste landlords in Bihar , armed with sophisticated weapons, had killed at least 21\\npeople including 6 children and 5 women on 25 January 1999 in Rukhsagar Bigha village\\nunder the Mehandia Police S tation in Jehanabad district of Bihar . The victims were all\\nfrom the backward castes and included several Dalits. The Commission, while taking\\ncognizance of the matter on 27 January 1999 expressed shock at the news of the killing of\\n21 Dalits in Jehanabad and effectively investigate and bring to book the guilty persons, and\\nto ensure that there was no recurrence of such incidents. It further directed the State\\nGovernment to grant relief and succour to the members of the families of the deceased\\nand to the injured victims.\\nNational Human Rights Commission neither does render decisions the way a Court of law\\ndoes, nor can its recommendations be enforced like judgements of the Courts. The\\nrecommendations of the Commission receive wide publicity and have a tremendous impact\\npolitically and socially . The role played by the Commission in the campaign against TADA\\nis worth mentioning. It has a temporary legislation which expired on 23 May 1995. When\\nTADA  lapsed a substitute legislation by the government was not cleared by Parliament.\\n25.6 Role of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)\\nThe impact of human rights has brought about a profound change on the notions of State\\nsovereignty . Today , no nation can say that the way it treats its citizens is purely a domestic\\nconcern. Globalisation of human rights with the modern concept of a global village has\\nresulted in the human rights situation anywhere in the world becoming a matter of international\\nconcern. Voluntary or ganizations, which are also called non-governmental or ganizations,\\nall over the world have begun to support and promote human rights in all societies.\\nThe actions of international non-governmental or ganizations like the Amnesty International\\nand the Human Rights Watch, and or ganizations like the People’ s Union for Civil Liberties\\nwith regard to massive human rights violations in the former Yugoslavia (Kosovo, Bosnia\\netc.), Rwanda, East Timor, Sierra Leone, Sudan, and Gujarat in India, and the number of'),\n",

The activities of such\\norganizations are coordinated at the international level through the Human Rights\\nCommission established by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1946.\\nAs a result of these activities of the non-governmental organizations it has now become\\nfamiliar requirement for States to submit reports to a statutory organ (Human Rights\\nCommittee, Children’ s Committee, Women’ s Committee, Committee on Elimination of\\nRacial Discrimination etc.) about their internal implementation of human rights obligations.\\nHalf a century back it would have appeared unthinkable that sovereign States would\\nperiodically submit a report to an international body about their internal matters involving\\ntreatment of their citizens by the government, and then the S tate’s participation in a\\ndiscussion of the report with members of an international body drawn from all over the\\nworld. Such is the power of the idea of human rights today . Impact of non-governmental\\norganizations with regard to protection and promotion of human rights is no longer debatable.\\nThe impact is clear and visible.

India too has one. Foreign policy refers to\\nthe sum total of principles, interests and objectives which a country promotes while interacting\\nwith other countries. Even though there are certain basic features of a foreign policy it is\\nnot a fixed concept. The thrust of foreign policy keeps on changing according to changing\\ninternational conditions. India’ s foreign policy is shaped by several factors including its\\nhistory , culture, geography and economy . Our Prime Minister , Jawaharlal Nehru, gave a\\ndefinite shape to the country’ s foreign policy .\\nObjectives\\nAfter studying this lesson, you will be able to\\n/circle6 identify the basic principles of India’ s foreign policy ;\\n/circle6 explain the meaning and significance of non-alignment ;\\n/circle6 analyse the relevance of non-alignment in the post cold war period ;\\n/circle6 explain the major concerns in India’ s foreign policy in the post cold war period ;\\n/circle6 recognise India’ s contribution to UN ef forts for peace and disarmament ;\\n/circle6 explain India’ s participation in UN peace keeping and its claim for a permanent seat\\nin the Security Council.\\n26.1 Basic Objectives and Principles of Foreign Policy\\nPreservation of national interest, achievement of world peace, disarmament, independence\\nfor Afro-Asian nations have been important objectives of India’ s foreign policy . These\\nobjectives are sought to be achieved through some principles viz. Panchsheel; non-\\nalignment; anti-colonialism, anti-imperialism, anti-racism, and strengthening the UN. It\\nwould be befitting to expand these principles.\\n26.1.1 Panchsheel\\nNehru was a believer in world peace. He understood the linkage between peace forE'),\n",

He had seen the destruction caused by the two\\nworld wars and therefore realized that for the progress of a nation a long spell of peace\\nwas needed. In its absence social and economic priorities relating to development tend to\\nget pushed to the background. The production of nuclear weapons strengthened Nehru’ s\\nfaith in the peaceful philosophy even more. Hence he gave utmost importance to world\\npeace in his policy planning. India’ s desired peaceful and friendly relations with all countries,\\nparticularly the big powers and the neighbouring nations, while signing an agreement with\\nChina, on April 28, 1954, India advocated adherence to five guiding principles known as\\nPanchsheel for the conduct of bilitral relations. It includes the following:\\n/circle6 Mutual respect for each other ’s territorial integrity and sovereignty .\\n/circle6 Mutual non-aggression\\n/circle6 Mutual non-interference in each other ’s internal af fairs\\n/circle6 Equality and mutual benefit\\n/circle6 Peaceful co-existence.\\nThe Panchsheel agreement enumerates best the principles of peaceful co-existence with\\nneighbours. It is an important component of India’ s foreign policy .\\n26.1.2 Non-alignment\\nNon-alignment has been regarded as the most important feature of India’ s foreign policy .\\nNon alignment aimed to maintain national independence in foreign affairs by not joining\\nany military alliance formed by the USA and Soviet Union in the aftermath of the Second\\nWorld War. Non-alignment was neither neutrality nor non-involvement nor isolationism. It\\nwas a dynamic concept which meant not committing to any military bloc but taking an\\nindependent stand on international issues according to the merits of each case. The policy\\nof non-alignment won many supporters in the developing countries as it provided an\\nopportunity to them for protecting their sovereignty as also retaining their freedom of\\naction during the tension ridden cold war period.\\nIndia played an important role in forging the non-aligned movement (NAM). The concept\\nof NAM emerged through a gradual process. Nehru took the initiative to convene the\\nAsian Relations Conference in New Delhi in 1947. Later on a Conference, of 29 countries\\nof Asia and Africa was held in Bandung (Indonesia) in 1955. This was the first gathering\\nof its kind which pledged to work together for colonial liberation, peace, cultural, economic\\nand political cooperation. Bandung to Belgrade in 1961 where the first NAM conference\\nwas held was a logical process to project an alternative to cold war bloc politics and\\nassertion of newly independent countries of their independent and sovereign rights.\\nCold War was intense rivalry between USA  and Soviet Union without fightling a direct\\nwar to attract allies in Africa, Asia and Latin America. It started soon after the Second\\nWorld War and continued for forty five years. These two big countries became two opposite\\npoles known as East and West. The world politics revolved around these two poles. Thus\\nthe world became bipolar .\\nAmong the non-aligned, Nehru had evolved special relationship with President Tito of\\nYugoslavia and Nasser of Egypt. These three are regarded as the founding fathers of the\\nNon-Aligned Movement. The non-aligned movement was a group of the newly independent\\nstates who refused to accept the dictates of the former colonial masters and decided to'),\n",

Non-aligned\\nmovement is anti-imperialist in approach. India as the prime architect of non-alignment\\nand as one of the leading members of the non-aligned movement has taken an active part\\nin its growth.\\nThe Non-Aligned Movement is providing all member states, regardless of size and\\nimportance, an opportunity to participate in global decision making and world politics. India\\nhosted the Seventh NAM Summit at New Delhi in 1983. India hoped NAM take up the\\ncause of development, disarmament and the Palestine question.\\nSince NAM was a product of the cold war scenario and the bipolar world, many scholars\\nhave questioned the relevance of NAM after the end of cold war and demise of the Soviet\\nUnion. However , even in the present scenario NAM has a significant role to play , First,\\nwith the disintegration of Soviet Union, the world faces threat from unipolar world. The\\nNAM can act as a check against US dominance. Secondly the developed (North) and\\ndeveloping (South) world are divided over several economic issues. The NAM remains a\\nvery relevant forum for third world countries to engage the developed nations in a productive\\ndialogue.Moreover , the NAM can prove to be powerful instrument for South-South\\ncooperation. Such a thing is essential if the third world countries are to increase their\\nbargaining power vis-a-vis the developed world. India continues to take active part in the\\nnon-aligned movement even after the end of cold war . Finally , the developing countries\\nunited under the forum of NAM have to fight for the reform of UN and change it according\\nto the requirements of 21st century .\\n26.1.3 Anti Imperialism, Anti Racism, Anti Colonialism\\nIndia has always opposed colonialism and racism. Whenever any injustice happened, India\\nraised her voice, for instance in favour of Indonesia’ s nationality fighting the Dutch\\ncolonialism in 1947, against South Africa’ s illegal occupation of Namibia and the infamous\\napartheid policy in South Africa India fully supported inclusion of communist China in the\\nUnited Nations.\\n26.1.4 S trengthening of UN\\nIndia has always viewed U N as a vehicle for peace and for peaceful change in world\\npolitics. Apart from this, India has always expected UN to actively involve countries to\\nmoderate their dif ferences through talks or negotiations. Further , India has advocated\\nactive role for UN in development ef fort of Third World countries.India has pleaded for a\\ncommon united front of the third world countries in the UN. It believes that the non-\\naligned world by virtue of its massive number could play a constructive and meaningful\\nrole in the UN by stopping the superpowers from using this world body for their own\\ndesigns. As early as 1950 India linked the reduction of armaments with the lar ger goal of\\ndevelopment.\\nThe UN has in fact played a key role in preserving world peace by helping in the\\ndecolonization process, by providing humanitarian and developmental assistance and through\\npeacekeeping.\\nDecolonization – refers to achiev ement of independence from colonial rule.

The new situation is made by greater uncertainty and complexity .\\nFor India, disintegration of the Soviet Union has meant uncertainty on several aspects viz.\\nsupply of weapons system, supply of spare parts, diplomatic support on Kashmir and other\\npolitico-strategic issues in and outside the United Nations and as a counter weight to US in\\nSouth Asia.During the last one decade and a half international politics has under gone\\nmajor changes. The cold war has ended, the world has become unipolar , a number of\\nstates have disintegrated, cold war military blocs have lost their significance, some such\\nblocs have dissolved and new regional economic blocs are shaping up. Globalisation has\\ngiven rise to new set of problems such as terrorism, money laundering, proliferation of\\nweapons, global warming etc. These problems are not endemic to any region but affect all\\nthe countries to some extent or the other . This has forced many nation states which were\\nhitherto enemies to cooperate with each other to solve problems which are universal in\\nnature. In this changed international scenario it has become imperative for UN to restructure\\nand reform itself if it is to effectively respond to emerging challenges.\\nMilitancy in Kashmir has emer ged as the formost challenge to our foreign policy . Pakistan\\nand the Western countries blamed India for violating human rights and denial of rights to\\nself determination.Gradually , India brought the situation under control.\\nBecause of the Kashmir dispute, India’ s relations with Pakistan sharply deteriorated. India\\naccused Pakistan of fanning trouble through cross border terrorism in Kashmir and other\\nparts of our country . India conducted nuclear weapon tests in 1998, followed by Pakistan’ s'),\n",

For example, India is interested in\\nstrengthening its relations without damaging its relations with Arab countries. Similarly ,\\nIndia’ s foreign policy is tackling new tasks like deepening economic and security\\ncooperation with the United States, while at the same time opposing unilateral actions\\nagainst Iraq and Yugoslavia.

Given the destructive capacity of nuclear\\nweapons, India has always believed that a world free of nuclear weapons would enhance\\nglobal security . Thus India has always advocated that highest priority be given to nuclear\\ndisarmament as a first step towards general and complete disarmament.\\nIndia has contributed to UN significantly on disarmament in terms of ideas, resolutions,\\ninitiatives and bridging differences through action plans. In 1948, India had proposed limiting\\nthe use of atomic energy to peaceful purposes and elimination of nuclear weapons from\\nnational arsenals. In 1950, India suggested formation of a UN Peace Fund created through\\npeaceful reduction of arms and directing the amount thus released towards development\\npurposes. In 1954, India advocated the cause for a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty .\\nIndia was the first to become party to partial Test Ban Treaty in 1963.

However , such\\ncomposition of the Security Council does not take into account the current global power\\nconfiguration which has changed since the days when these countries were inducted as\\npermanent members. Since India has emerged as the fourth fastest growing economy and\\nalso because of the leadership it has provided in all international fora, its contribution to\\nUN peacekeeping, its track record in espousing the cause of the third world, India has a\\nstrong case for a permanent seat in the Security Council. We are getting support from\\nmany friendly countries. A final decision on the matter is likely to take some time, because\\nof its complexity .\\nIntext Questions 26.5\\nQ. 1.

In fact some of its basic features such as non-alignment still\\nremain significant and relevant. The proof of the durability of some decades old principles\\nlie in the efforts of India and China to revive the fifty year old Panchsheel as the basis of\\nbilateral relations. India has contributed significantly to UN efforts for peace and\\ndisarmament and to UN peacekeeping operations. Even as India is poised to become an\\neconomic superpower in the coming times, it always has and in future too will take necessary\\nsteps to further its national interest in every respect i.e. political, strategic and economic\\nterms.'),\n",

These countries were militarily and economically so\\nstrong as compared to other states that they could project their power to every nook and\\ncorner of the world. When India attained independence in 1947, it wanted to have good\\nrelations with both the countries. It was widely believed that a natural tie would exist\\nbetween India and the US since India seemed destined to emer ge as the world’ s largest\\nand Asia’ s first, fully democratic state. And the US was considered the most powerful and\\ncelebrated democracy of the world. So far as the relationship between India and the\\nUSSR was concerned, a number of commonalties were easily noticed.

The Atlantic Charter , spelt out by the\\nUS and Britain, had offered hope of a new dawn to the suppressed people of the world\\nonce the War had been successfully concluded. America got a lot of credit in Indian eyes\\nfor this. However , Britain subsequently declared that the Charter applied solely to fellow\\nEuropeans under Hitler ’s Nazi occupation.\\n27.1.1 Relations in the Cold War Years\\nThe relations between India and the US failed to achieve their full potential. Many factors\\nwere responsible in determining the actual course. This was due to the preoccupation of\\nthe United S tates with the ‘containment of communis m’ which started the Cold War\\nbetween the US and the Soviet Union. The newly independent India, led by our first Prime\\nMinister Jawaharlal Nehru, refused to be drawn into the Cold War politics of competitive\\nmilitary alliances promoted by both the super powers. Nehru chose the policy of ‘non-\\nalignment’ which aimed to give India the much-needed independence of action in the\\nsphere of foreign policy and relations. America regarded India’ s refusal to collaborate as\\na sign of unfriendliness. The cause of better Indo-US relations received a blow in 1954.\\nThe US through Cold war brought rivalry to India’ s doorsteps by forming two military\\norganisation SEA TO and CENT O with Pakistan who joined these alliances as a key mem-\\nber. The US military aided Pakistan, given to check the spread of communism, was used\\nagainst India contrary to initial assurances.\\nIntext Questions 27.1\\nFill in the blanks :\\n1.

Name the American President who visited India in 1977.\\n(Jimmi Carter) (Richard Nixon)\\nThe October 1962 war between India and China introduced a new element in the Indo-US\\nrelations. Within India, there were for the first time many voices strongly advocating an\\nalliance with the US against China. Many also wanted a drastic modification of the non-\\nalignment policy . There was perhaps an expectation in the US too that India could now be\\nprepared to head an anti-Chinese and anti-Communist alliance. When the Chinese inva-\\nsion scaled up, the Government of India made an ur gent appeal to Washington (US) for\\nmilitary supplies. In a speedy response, the US President John F . Kennedy provided India\\nwith small arms and equipment. The first batch of arms arrived even before the signing of\\na deal between the two countries. Further , the US agreed to payment for these arms in\\nrupees.\\nHowever , the pro-American  goodwill in India evaporated with the US reluctance to openly\\nblame Pakistan for starting the 1965 war against India. In addition to US support to Paki-\\nstan, US war on Vietnam contributed to certain coldness in Indo-US relations in 1960s. In\\nthe beginning of 1970s, the US rapprochement with China (with Pakistan help) was an-\\nother turning point.'),\n",

The US adminis-\\ntration (government) took the position that the East Pakistan’ s (present-day Bangladesh)\\nrevolt was a movement to break up Pakistan and that Pakistan’ s brutal attempts to sup-\\npress it were justified. During the Bangladesh war (1971) the US moved a anti India\\nresolution in the Security Council and USA froze its economic assistance to India. The\\nonly assistance that continued was food distributed free by voluntary agencies. Not only\\nthat, Washington also made military moves. A part of the US Seventh Fleet was ordered\\ninto the Bay of Bengal. The nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Enterprise  sailed to-\\nwards the Bay of Bengal in a show of solidarity with Pakistan army which could be saved\\nfrom defeat in Bangladesh. It took some time (a couple of years) for the US to recognize\\nIndia as the major country in the South Asian region. It was in this spirit of reconciliation,\\nIndia hosted President Carter ’s visit in 1977.\\nHowever , once again another blo w struck. The Soviet invasion of Afganistan in 1979 had\\nthrown India and United States on opposite sides. Pakistan became the closest ally to\\nfacilitate military help to Afghan Mujahiddeen. No doubt India’ s initial sympathies with the\\nSoviet action against Afghanistan harmed relations with America.\\n27.1.2 American Aid to India\\nThere was a slow start to the economic assistance that India received from the US.\\nIndia’ s food production at the time of independence was insuf ficient to feed its millions; its\\nindustrial and service sector were also quite backward. That is why , India was dependent\\non other countries for bilateral assistance. The first of the many food aid shipments to\\nIndia from the US started in 1951. In 1954, the US Congress passed a Public Law 480 (PL\\n480) allowing the sale of surplus American wheat to India. India continued to receive\\nfoodgrains from the US under PL 480 till the early 1970s.\\nThe story of suspicions in political relationship uses only one side of the coin. During the\\ncold war , despite political dif ferences, India received significant economic and food aid\\nfrom the US, right from 1950s.\\nIn addition to food assistance, the US had provided large bilateral developmental assis-\\ntance to India. However , you must not for get that this assistance was not available for the\\ndevelopment of heavy industr y but in the field of agriculture, development of raw materi-\\nals and minerals. For creating a heavy industrial base, India had to turn to the Soviet\\nUnion. The development assistance given by the US reached a peak of around $500\\nmillion in 1962.During the Bangladesh war , the US froze its economic aid to India. How-\\never, the bilateral assistance started in 1978 after a long gap. But the importance of bilat-\\neral aid decreased from the late 1970s onwards because of the substantial increase in\\nmultilateral assistance given by the International Development Authority (IDA), the soft-\\nmoney af filiate of the World Bank. Much of the IDA  money was, of course, funded\\nindirectly by the US. In the 1980s, the World Bank lending typically ran into $2 billion (one\\nbillion is one hundred crores or one thousand million). So, for India, the US stance towards\\nmultilateral financial institution mattered more than the bilateral aid. US had no objection\\nto clear India’ s request for a $5.8 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF)\\nin 1981 - the lar gest ever sought by a m ember country .\\n27.1.3 Contemporary Indo-US Relations\\nThe end of the Cold War in 1990s left the United S tates as the lone super power . This new\\nreality brought a reappraisal of the Indo-US relations. New opportunities came up to bring\\nIndia and US close. Military-military contacts commenced; American investments started'),\n",

President Clinton paid a hugely successful visit to\\nIndia in 2000. On political front terrorism, non-prolification have been major issues. One of\\nthe turning points of Indo-US relations in recent years was the American role in the Kar gil\\ncrisis in 1999. India viewed President Bill J Clinton’ s role during the 1999 Kar gil crisis in\\npersuading Pakistan to withdraw its troops from the Indian side of the Line of Control\\n(LOC) in Kashmir as an important milestone.\\nIndia tried to impress the importance of fighting the menace of terrorism, by highlighting\\nPakistan’ s role in Jammu and Kashmir . But the United S tates did not show much interest\\nin acting against terrorism till the US cities (New York and Washington) were struck in a\\nbig way on 1 1th September 2001. India of fered full cooperation to the US in counter\\nterrorism compaign. However our plea to US that Pakistan’ s support to Taliban in Af-\\nghanistan, and Jehadists in Kashmir made it the ‘epicentre’ of international terrorism fell\\non deaf ears. The US needed Pakistan more than India to contact Al-Qaeda terrorists. So\\nUS distinguished ‘goo d’ terrorists and bad terrorists. They extended sympathy when ter-\\nrorists attacted Kashmir Assembly and India’ s Parliament in October and December 2001\\nrespectively . Anxious to enlist allies in the war against terrorism, USA  reverted to Cold\\nWar partnership with Pakistan. Once highly critical of the military regime in Pakistan run\\nby General Pervez Musharraf, Washington now welcomed Musharraf as a full-fledged\\npartner in the international coalition against terrorism. The Bush administration lifted the\\nsanctions against Pakistan, pledged to provide generous assistance and gave the Musharraf\\ngovernment a legitimacy it had never before enjoyed. India legitimately feared that Wash-\\nington would tilt toward Islamabad once more.\\nUSA  was alarmed that events might go out of control. To show New Delhi that it took\\nseriously India’ s accusations about Pakistan’ s collusion in these attacks, the administration\\nof President George Bush placed the two Pakistan-based groups, India thought respon-\\nsible for the attacks on the US list of terrorist organizations. While not publicly accepting\\nIndia’ s claim that the Pakistani government itself was involved in terrorist activities,\\nWashington’ s words and actions clearly implied that Islamabad could and must do more to\\ncrack down on terrorism.\\nUS besides countries like Canada, helped India established nuclear power stations in 1963.\\nBut the cooperation came under a cloud in 1970s, because of India’ s peaceful nuclear\\nexplosion at Pokhran in 1974 and India’ s refusal to sign nuclear non-prolification treaty .\\nIn 1978, the US Congress passed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act in 1978. This law\\nstipulated that uranium could be exported to those countries which allow all their nuclear\\nplants to be inspected and safeguarded by the International Atomic Ener gy Agency (IAEA).\\nIt must not be for gotten that non-proliferation has been a steadfast goal of the US. And\\nmajor differences between the two countries over nuclear issues persisted. The US hoped\\nthat India would sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) of 1996, but India did\\nnot. When it detonated five nuclear bombs in May 1998 again at Pokhran and declared\\nitself a nuclear weapons state, the US imposed military and economic sanctions. Bilateral\\nrelations seemed to have reached a new low , but India stood its ground. For two years, a\\nnumber of discussions between Jaswant Singh, then Foreign Minister of India and Strobe\\nTalbott, the US deputy secretary of state were held. Not since the early 1960s had the two\\ncountries engaged each other in such a serious and sustained fashion. These discussions\\ntransformed the bilateral relationship to a large extent. In 1999 US Congress lifted some\\nof the sanctions against India. This was the first among many such subsequent instances'),\n",

In December\\n1953, India and the Soviet Union signed a long–term trade agreement. An attractive fea-\\nture of this agreement was the fact that payment for Indian imports could be made in\\nrupees and not in hard currency like dollar . Trade with the Western countries, by contrast,\\nwas in hard currency . For this purpose, accounts of the Soviet Union were opened and\\nmaintained in several Indian banks.\\nMilitary supplies to India emerged as a prominent symbol of Indo-Soviet friendship. In\\n1962, just before the India-China war , the MiG (the fighter aircraft) deal was signed\\ndespite Chinese protest. The USSR replaced the British as the biggest supplier of fighter\\naircraft.\\nThe Soviet Union hosted a meeting of leaders of India and Pakistan in Tashkant in January\\n1966 after the 1965 war . In August 1971, the Soviet and the Indian leaders signed the\\nhistoric Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Cooperation, the first of its kind that India had\\nsigned. The Treaty provided for immediate mutual consultations in case either country\\nwas attacked from outside. This clearly signalled Moscow’ s commitment to stand by India\\non the Bangladesh question.\\nIndia, in a way , reciprocated with support to the Soviet Union after it invaded Afghanistan\\nin December 1979. India was restrained in its public statements. For India, the Afghani-\\nstan issue had been somewhat overshadowed by the virtual military alliance between\\nPakistan and the US.\\nWith the coming to power of Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985, the Soviet foreign relations went\\nthrough a sea change. The emphasis shifted to the need for mutually beneficial relations\\nwith the US and the West. His ef forts to build a “Common European Home” undermined\\nthe importance of the developing world like India.

During\\nYeltsin’ s visit to India in 1993, the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation was signed between\\nIndia and Russia. It replaced the 1971 Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Cooperation. The\\nsecurity clause of the earlier Treaty was abandoned while the two countries resolved to\\ncontinue their peaceful and friendly relation. Another important breakthrough was the\\nagreement on debts and Ruble-Rupee exchange rates. A Treaty on cooperation in military\\nfield was also signed and Yeltsin confirmed once again that India would receive cryogenic\\nrocket engines despite US objections.\\nThe Indo-Russian relations attained a new high and momentum with the signing of Declaration\\non Strategic Partnership during the visit of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Indian\\nPrime Minister Vajpayee’ s November 2001 visit resulted in the signing of the Declaration\\non International Terrorism. This declaration condemned the double standards adopted by\\nthe west on terrorism.\\nAlthough Russia is not a super power any more, its significance for India cannot be\\nunderestimated. Being a permanent member of the Security Council of the UN, it has the\\npower of veto. Further , as you already know , Russia is the only important world power\\nthat has consistently supported the Indian position on Kashmir and cross-border terrorism.\\nIt holds Pakistan responsible for the spread of religious extremism and terrorism in this\\npart of the world. The most recent support for Kashmir came in the form of the joint\\nstatement issued at the end of three days visit of Prime Minister Vajpayee to Moscow in\\nNovember 2003. It called upon Pakistan to prevent infiltration of terrorists across the\\nLOC and at the other points of the border into the state of Jammu and Kashmir . It also\\nasked Pakistan to dismantle the terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-controlled\\nterritory as a condition for purposeful dialogue between the two countries. Among the\\npermanent members of the UN Security Council, Russia is the most prominent and\\nunequivocal supporter of India’ s candidature for permanent membership in an expanded\\nSecurity Council.\\n Russia remains India’ s most reliable supplier of high-quality military equipment. Russia\\nsupplies more than seventy per cent of India’ s defence need including the state-of-the-art\\nweapon systems and the technologies. The major Russian defence export include fighter\\naircraft (such as MiG-21), main battle tanks (like T-72MI), helicopters, anti-tank missiles,\\nanti-ship missiles, submarines, nuclear submarine (of Akula-2 class) and aircraft carrier\\n(such as Gorskhov). In a “landmark deal” in January 2004, India agreed to buy the refur-\\nbished Admiral Gorskhov along with 12 Mig-29 fighter aircraft. The aircraft carrier will be\\ndelivered to India by 2008. Defence co-operation between India and Russian is not limited\\nto procurement but includes production of many of these weapon systems in India (e.g.\\nMig-27M, Sukhoi- 30MK, T-72 tanks, etc.). It also covers areas like joint research and\\ndevelopment and service to service co-operation. One of the most striking examples is the\\nIndo-Russian joint endeavour to develop, manufacture and market the supersonic (flying\\nfaster than the speed of sound) Anti-Ship Cruise Missile Systems, BrahMos.\\nIndia and Russia have enjoyed strong historical ties. In the present international scenario,\\ntheir views of the world coincide to a large extent. This is further complemented by the\\nmutuality of their security and economic interests. Indo-Russian trade is the weakest link\\nin an otherwise excellent relationship.

Energy  Cooperation is one of them.  India is emerging as a large consumer of\\nenergy. Russia’ s oil and gas reserves and its expertise in thermal, hydropower and nuclear\\nenergy sector will be crucial in ensuring India’ s ener gy security in future. A number of\\nthermal and hydropower projects have already been built with Soviet/ Russian collabora-\\ntion. India’ s ambitious goals in the field of nuclear ener gy need Russian help since it is the\\nonly important nuclear power which is ready to co-operate with India in the atomic energy\\nsector .\\nWhat You Have Learnt\\nIndia and the US are two great democracies. But for a long time the relationship between\\nthem was far from smooth. The containment of communism was the major goal of the US\\npolicy during the Cold War. But India did not want to join the Cold War politics. So India\\nfollowed the independent policy of non-alignment. And this was not to the liking of the\\nAmericans. The relations between the two got strained when the US supplied arms to\\nPakistan in the mid-1950s, despite the fact that the US was providing the bilateral eco-\\nnomic aid including PL  480 food assistance to India. The American support to India in the\\nearly sixties during the Chinese invasion did bring about goodwill for the Americans. But it\\nwas short-lived. The conditions attached to the food aid later in the decade created prob-\\nlems in Indo-US relations. The open support for Pakistan in the Bangladesh War and the\\nsending of USS Enterprise  to the Bay of Bengal brought about the lowest point in the\\nrelationship. The post-Cold War period saw a change in the relationship, especially when\\nAmerica pressurized Pakistan to withdraw troops from the Indian side of the LOC during\\nthe Kar gil War in 1999. Further , American acceptance of India as a responsible state with\\nnuclear weapons did lift up the relationship.\\nIndo-Soviet Union relationship was based on a number of common grounds from the\\nbeginning. The support of the Soviet Union on the Kashmir issue added depth to the\\nrelationship. Further , the Soviet aid came in for the building of a self-reliant economy\\nincluding infrastructure projects like the Bhilai steel plant. Indian armed forces received a\\nlot of Soviet arms and ammunition. The Soviet Union allowed the production of fighter\\naircraft like the MiG in India. The high point of Indo-Soviet relationship was reached\\nduring the Bangladesh crisis in 1971 when India and the Soviet Union signed the friendship\\ntreaty . The immediate post-Cold War period did see some downturn in the relationship but\\nrecently it has been put on track.\\nTerminal Exer cises\\n1.

Historically , several historians\\nhave successfully traced the cultural linkages dating back to 2nd century BC.\\nAs a result of the communist revolution in 1949, China became the People’ s Republic of\\nChina (PRC), under the leadership of Mao Tse Tung.

India, on the other hand, tried\\nits best to come close to China. It was the first non-communist country to recognise\\ncommunist China in 1949. India fully supported China’ s claim for membership in the United\\nNations. It also acknowledged China’ s claim over Formosa (T aiwan). It refused to be a\\nparty to peace treaty with Japan without China. In the Korean crisis too, India refused to\\nbrand China as aggressor when China intervened on behalf of North Korea. In fact, India\\nsupported China even though the Western bloc especially USA  was displeased with it.\\nNehru’ s China policy received the first jolt in 1950, when China occupied Tibet in 1950. It\\nis important to remember in this context that India had long term interests in Tibet because\\nit was a buffer lying between India and China. India even enjoyed certain special privileges\\nin Tibet. Therefore direct Chinese control over Tibet was likely to endanger these, and\\nIndia’ s security .\\nIndia’ s suggestions for a peaceful settlement of the Tibet problem were treated as\\ninterference by the communist regime. Gradually the Tibetans grew restless under China’ s\\nyoke and rose in revolt in 1959. China ruthlessly suppressed the movement and declared\\nTibet as an integral part of China. The head of Tibet, Dalai Lama took shelter in India while\\nTibet lost whatever autonomy it still enjoyed. The granting of political shelter to Dalai\\nLama by India added to China’ s distrust.\\nChina appreciated India’ s neutral and mediatory role in easing the Korean problem (1950-\\n53). Thus, began a period of friendship between the two countries, with the signing of the\\nSino-Indian Treaty of friendship in 1954. This treaty put a seal of approval upon Chinese\\nsuzerainty over Tibet. The Preamble of the treaty embodies the famous ‘Panchsheel\\nPrinciples’ about which you have studied (lesson number 26). This agreement initiated a\\nperiod of relaxed relationship, marked by the slogan of Hindi Chini Bhai Bhai.  It is\\ninteresting to note that at the Bandung Conference (1955), Nehru actively brought China\\ninto the hold of the Afro-Asian solidarity .\\n28.1.1 Boundary Dispute between India and China\\nThe 1950s were marked by the boundary dispute between India and China, the flash point\\nof which unfortunately caused a war between the two countries in 1962. China first started\\nto claim lar ge parts of Indian territory in North East Frontier Agency (NEF A, now Arunachal\\nPradesh) and Ladakh by publishing maps in which these were shown as included in China.\\nChina continued extending its borders and also constructed a 1 10 mile long road across\\nAksai China area (Ladakh) of India in 1956-57. In 1959, China put claim to some 50, appa\\nsq. miles of Indian territory and also denied the validity of McMahon Line.\\nMcMahon Line  This is the boundary line between India and China, east of Bhutan.\\nIt was determined in 1914 at a Conference of representatives of British India, Tibet\\nand China. The Secretary of S tate for India (in British Cabinet) Arthur Henry\\nMcMahon represented British India in the Conference.\\nBy this time Tibet had been fully integrated into China; it was in a strong position at the\\nIndia-China border with Chinese troops posted all along. While the two countries were in\\ndispute over the McMahon line issue, China launched a massive attack on India in October\\n1962, in the NEF A as well as the Ladakh sector . After overrunning lar ge areas of Indian\\nterritory , China announced a unilateral ceasefire after occuping huge territory of India 200\\nsq. miles in the North Eastern sector and 15,000 sq. miles in Ladakh.'),\n",

The Colombo Proposals failed because China refused to agree on conditions\\ncontained in them. For long in the years following the war , China–India relations did not\\nshow any improvement. In fact, China went out of the way to make friends with Pakistan,\\njust to isolate and contain India.\\n28.1.2 Normalisation of Relations\\nAlthough the two countries resumed diplomatic relations in 1976 by exchanging\\nambassadors. The efforts of normalisation of Sino-Indian relations received a boost when\\nthe then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi paid a successful five day visit to China in 1988. The\\ntwo countries pledged to settle the border dispute through dialogue. Several high level\\nvisits followed including visit by Ex-Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 2003. The two\\ncountries agreed to keep the border dispute apart, and develop friendly relations in other\\nfields. Until the b order dispute is resolved, both countries agreed to maintain peace and\\ntranquility on the Line of Actual Control (LAC).\\nOne could see a clear shift in the Chinese attitude towards India. The fact that erstwhile\\nUSSR had mended fences with China, there were no more apprehensions from the South.\\nMoreover , China’ s post-1979 economic transformation demanded big markets for its\\nmassive production under economic liberalisation. President Jiang Zemin’ s visit to India in\\n1996 witnessed a major consolidation of this progress. This was first ever visit of China’ s\\nhead of S tate to India. China’ s withdrawal of support to Naga and Mizo rebels; meaningful\\nsilence on the status of Sikkim (China considered Sikkim’ s status as that of an independent\\nstate) and a neutral stand on Kashmir issue could be seen as positive shift in Chinese\\nattitude towards India.\\nNevertheless, there was sudde nly a brief setback in the mutual ties of the two after the\\nnuclear explosions by India during 1998. These were followed by sharp Chinese reaction\\nand its leading role in getting the resolutions condemning the tests in UN and similar fora,\\npassed. These tests by India were seen as neutralising Chinese prominence in the region.\\nBut the Chinese posture of neutrality during the Indo-Pak military showdown in Kashmir ,\\nKargil sector in 1999 exhibited China’ s inclination to toe a softer and friendly line with\\nIndia. In fact, Chinese refusal to interfere in the conflict forced Pakistan for cessation of\\nhostilities with India.\\nHowever , Ex-Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’ s 2003 visit to China is a renewed\\neffort in the promotion of close and cordial ties between the two neighbours. The border\\nagreement has recognised the Nathula Pass in Sikkim as a border pass, implying that\\nChina no more considers Sikkim as an independent state. Another positive breakthrough\\nwas the Joint Declaration that underlined the need to explore a framework of a boundary\\nsettlement at political level of bilateral relations. This is an acknowledgement that the key\\nissue in resolving the dispute is political. This is seen as Beijing’ s readiness to give up its\\npolicy of delaying dialogue. India’ s National Security Advisor and Chinese Vice Minister\\nhave been appointed for holding the tasks. The developments at the diplomatic and political\\nlevels have been supplemented by fresh initiatives at the economic level to strengthen\\nbilateral relations. The borde r trade between India and China has crossed $ 10 billion\\nquickly .'),\n",

Yet they\\nhave perpetually been in a state of undeclared war with varying degree of intensity .\\nPakistan’ s aggression in Kar gil (1999) brought the two countries even on the ver ge of a\\nnuclear confrontation. The legacy of suspicion and mistrust predates the partition of India\\nin 1947. During the freedom struggle the Muslim League, under the leadership of\\nMohammad Ali Jinnah propounded the two-nation theory , in support of a separate Muslim\\nstate. Jinnah insisted that since Hindus and Muslims were two communities, two separate\\nstates must be constituted for the two communities. The Indian National Congress (INC)’ s\\nlong rejection of and reluctant acceptance of partition gave room for suspicion in Pakistan\\nthat India would try to undo the partition and divide Pakistan. Moreover , Pakistan was\\nconcerned at the possibility of India’ s domination in the region and its inability to match\\nIndia’ s power all by itself. Pakistan developed a perception that it is an incomplete state\\nwithout Kashmir being incorporated into it. On the other hand, India perceives Kashmir ’s\\naccession and integration into India as an essential element of its secular and federal\\ndemocratic structure.\\n28.2.1 The Kashmir Issue\\nAt the time of partition Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) was one of those several princely\\nstates, the fate of which was left uncertain in 1947. Pakistan desired that Kashmir with\\nMuslim majority population should join Muslim country , Pakistan. But the popular leader of\\nNational Congress opposed Pakistan’ s ideology . Maharaja Hari Singh did not take a decision\\nuntil Pakistan sent armed intruders into the Kashmir valley in October 1947. Seeking\\nIndian help to repulse the Pakistani intruders Maharaja signed the ‘Instrument of Accession’\\nmaking Jammu and Kashmir a part of Indian Union. On this occasion, as true democrat,\\nPrime Minister Nehru assured that after Pakistani aggression was cleared, the future\\nstatus of the state would be decided on the basis of wishes of the people of Kashmir .\\nSince India did not want an open clash with Pakistan, it referred the matter to the United\\nNations. Indian forces saved Srinagar from the invaders, pushed back the Pakistanis from\\nthe Kashmir Valley . But the whole of Kashmir could not be recaptured, at it would have\\nmeant direct and difficult war between the two new nations. India sought United Nations\\nhelp in 1948. A ceasefire came to be implemented on January 1, 1949. It left a lar ge part'),\n",

In 1950s the UN mediators put forward several\\nplans to resolve the dispute, but they failed to bridge the differences between the two\\nconuntries.\\nThe problem of Kashmir is still pending. Plebiscite was to be conducted only after Pakistan\\nwithdrew its forces from the occupied territory , as per the UN resolution of 1948, which\\nPakistan refused to comply . Hence India pleaded that the wishes of the people were\\nascertained in 1954 in the form the direct election to the Constituent Assembly which\\nsatisfied the accession of Jammu and Kashmir to India. The mediation come to an end.\\nPakistan was desperate to capture Kashmir . Thinking that India’ s army was weak after\\ndefeat in the war with China in 1962, Pakistan tried through a war to take Kashmir in\\n1965. But Indian forces defeated the Pakistani designs.\\nLoC The Ceasefire line determined in 1949 was called the LoC after 1972. Some\\npeople believe that the possible solution to Indo-Pak problem on Kashmir is the\\nconversion of LoC into international boundary .\\nMoreover , Pakistan suf fered another humiliation, when its eastern wing, 1000 miles away\\nfrom West Pakistan successfully waged independence struggle in 1971. India played a\\nkey role in the war to liberate Bangladesh. The birth of Bangladesh proved to be the final\\nburial of two-nation theory on the basis of which Pakistan put a claim to Kashmir . Pakistan\\nwas reduced to one-fourth of the size of India. This altered the power equation in South\\nAsia in India’ s favour .\\nIn order to normalise relations India invited Pakistan for an agreement, the result of which\\nwas the Shimla Pact of 1972. This Shimla agreement however bears important significance\\nas the two countries agreed to seek the settlement of all bilateral problems, including\\nKashmir , mutually without the intervention of any third party . Thus under the Shimla Pact,\\nthe Kashmir issue cannot be raised in international or any other forum, although Pakistan\\nhas not hesitated to ignore the sprit of the agreement. The agreement also talked about the\\nreturn of Prisoners of War (POW). Though Pakistan’ s territory in India’ s possession was\\nreturned, a new cease-fire line (in place of the old cease-fire line of 1948–49) was drawn,\\nwhich is known as the LoC, Pakistan found ways other than open war to destabilise India\\nby encouraging and assisting terrorism in Punjab, and the State-sponsored militancy in\\nJammu and Kashmir since the mid 1980s. Pakistan still continues to encourage terrorist\\nand separatist tendencies in Kashmir , operating mainly from terrorist training camps situated\\nin POK.\\nThe sanctity of the LoC that came to be agreed upon between India and Pakistan under the\\nShimla Agreement of 1972, was violated by Pakistan in May 1999 as a part of a big plan.\\nThis was done when the Pakistani forces infiltrated into India, after crossing the line of\\ncontrol in Kargil, Drass and Batelik sectors of J &K. Indian army once again gave a\\nbefitting defeat in a war that continued for about 60 days. The purpose of Pakistani operation\\nin Kar gil was to create a crisis with a threat of nuclear war , which would in turn ensure\\nintervention by the United States in its favour on Kashmir dispute. Neither United States\\nnor China came to Pakistan’ s help. In fact, Pakistan had a diplomatic and military defeat.\\n28.2.2 Nuclear  Tests and Ef forts Towards Impr ovement of\\nRelations\\nIndo-Pakistan relations acquired an entirely new dimension in the context of nuclear tests'),\n",

That, some meeting ground\\nbetween the two neighbours has to be found. Thus, foreign secretary level talks started,\\nand a direct bus service between Delhi and Lahore was proposed. Prime Minister Vajpayee’ s\\nBus Diplomacy in 1999 marked a tremendous goodwill between the two countries. The\\nLahore Declaration signed at the time underlined the need for resolving all outstanding\\nissues, including that of Kashmir , through peaceful means. While India agreed to bring\\nKashmir onto the agreed agenda along with other areas of mutual benefits, Pakistan\\nconceded to bilateralism. The reference to the ‘composite and integrated’ dialogue process\\nimplied that the two would not be a hostage to any single issue. Despite the rupture caused\\nby the Kargil war and the terrorist attack against our Parliament (December 2001) the\\nunconditional dialogue has been resumed.

The history of cultural relations\\nbetween India and Sri Lanka dates back to the ancient times. Out of the total population of\\nSri Lanka, about 64 percent believe in Buddhism and about 15 percent believe in Hinduism.\\nSri Lanka became a British colony in early 19th century . It was granted independence on\\nFebruary 4, 1948.\\nIndia-Sri Lanka relations have generally been cordial, though there have been occasions of\\ntense relations due to the ethnic conflict between Tamils and the Sinhalese. Despite ethnic\\nproblems, India has never sought to impose its will on Sri Lanka and has always based its\\nforeign policy towards this southern neighbour on mutual understanding and friendship. An\\nimportant area of common interest between the two neighbours is the foreign policy of\\nnon-alignment. Sri Lanka has generally stood neutral in Sino-Indian disputes. In fact, it\\nmade efforts to mediate between India and China after the war of 1962. Sri Lanka also\\nshowed understanding when India become nuclear . Recently in 2005, India extended valuable\\nhelp to Sri Lanka after Tsunami devastated the coastal areas of that country .\\n28.3.1 Pr oblem of Indian Tamils\\nJaffna province of Sri Lanka has lar ge concentration of Tamil population. The problem\\nbecame serious when Tamilians began demanding a national homeland or “Eelam” in\\nnorthern Sri Lanka. It is important to understand that there are essentially two categories\\nof Tamilians in Sri Lanka: The Ceylon T amils  whose forefathers had migrated to Sri\\nLanka centuries ago. They are estimated to be one million. The second category is of\\nIndian T amils whose forefathers were taken by the Britishers as plantation workers in\\nthe 19th century . They are another one million, many of them without citizenship. The\\nproblem of their status dominated early India-Sri Lanka relations. The conflict with Ceylon\\nTamils came later .\\nThe Sinhalese fear Tamil domination, which is the principal reason behind the ethnic conflict.\\nThe difference between the two communities was exploited by British rulers in order to\\ncheck the growing Sinhalese nationalism. The Tamils were allowed to enter the\\nadministration structure and thus gradually took control of the trade and profession. Scarce\\neconomic resources and opportunities plus the majority pressure from its own people\\nforced the Government of Sri Lanka to pass series of steps to reducing the importance of\\nTamils- Indian and the Ceylonese. The representation of Tamilians in public service in\\n1948 was 30 percent, but by 1975 it had fallen to mere 5 percent. The Sinhalese were\\nencouraged to settle down in Tamil dominated areas in lar ge numbers. The citizenship law\\nof 1948 and 1949 had deprived about 10 lakh Indian Tamils of political rights. The Tamil\\nyouth who had lost faith in non-violence or ganised themselves into Liberation Tigers. The\\naim of these ‘T igers’  is a sovereign Tamil S tate of Eelam.\\nThe issue of Tamilians, and the policy pursued by government cast a dark shadow on\\nIndo-Sri Lanka relations. India from time to time complained against the discriminatory\\npolicy of the Ceylon government. The agreement of 1964 sought to solve the problem of\\nstateless persons (Indian Tamils) in Sri Lanka. About 3 lakhs of these people were to be\\ngranted Sri Lankan citizenship and about 5 lakh 25 thousand persons were to be given\\ncitizenship of India. These people were given 15 years time to shift to India in instalments.\\nLater in 1974, the fate of the rest 1 lakh 50 thousand stateless persons was decided. It was\\nagreed between the two countries that half of them were to be given citizenship of Sri\\nLanka and rest would become Indian nationals. Thus, the issue of stateless persons was\\nsorted out peacefully between the two countries.'),\n",

It assumed serious\\nproportions in 1983. As the gulf between the communities developed, militancy , separatist\\norganisations became active. Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) demanded separate\\nhomeland for Tamils in 1988 – Tamil Eelam. A reign of terror was unleashed against the\\nagitating Tamils in 1983. During 1983 – 86, about 2 lakh Tamils were rendered homeless.\\nThe worst racial riots in the history of the country made thousands of Tamils refugees in\\nIndia.\\nIndia offered to help resolve the crisis but it was interpreted as “Indian intervention in Sri\\nLanka” on behalf of the Tamils. When the situation became grim, India and Sri Lanka\\nsigned an agreement in 1987. India of fered military assistance under the Accord. Indian\\nPeace Keeping Force (IPKF) was sent to Sri Lanka to help restore normalcy in the\\ncountry . The deployment of IPKF was also an extension of India’ s policy of reminding Sri\\nLanka and outside powers that if their involvement inside the region were to have an anti-\\nIndian orientation, New Delhi would not remain a mute spectator .\\nThough the accord of 1987 was a triumph of Indian diplomacy , it proved to be costly for\\nIndia. India lost about 1200 soldiers and it costed Rs. 2 crore a day on IPKF in the height of\\nits involvement. The worst part was that the Tamils turned against IPKF and a fighting\\nbroke out between the two.

It also refers to\\nrespect for and enforcement of rules. Day-to-day activities would be normal and peaceful\\nif order exists. In the world affairs, order brings a certain method in the way one country\\nconducts its affairs with other states. The method can be noticed in the form of a set of\\nrules and principles, which are commonly accepted and respected by governments. These\\nrules and principles include equality of all countries, that one country should not interfere in\\nthe internal affairs of another state, that force should not be used or even threatened in the\\nbilateral relations, that prisoners of wars and refugees should be treated humanely , etc.\\nFor assisting countries to make and implement these rules, they often establish common\\ninstitutions like the United Nations. They are meant to assist in sorting out differences and\\nproblems between countries through dialogue and diplomacy .\\nThe phrase ‘world order ’ may sound strange in the light of opposite realities. Though the\\nstates are supposedly equal in a formal sense, there are gross inequalities among them.\\nAnd some of these inequalities have been recognised in the form of veto power conferred\\non five permanent members in the UN Security Council. Countries often compete for\\nresources and influence, they suspect each other ’s intentions and ambitions, and they\\nquarrel about borders, trade and several other issues. In fact, right now a dozen wars are\\ngoing on in counties of Asia, Africa and Europe causing death to millions and destruction\\nof valuable property . Moreover , problems arise not just between states but also within\\nthose states. Many states are fighting civil wars. Civil war is a prolonged situation of brutal\\nwar between state military and certain groups of people wanting to remove a government\\nfrom seat of power or form their own separate state. Sri Lanka is a good example of\\ncountries fighting a civil war . Linked to this aspect is the spread of terrorism, which causes\\nfear among common people through indiscriminate violence and inhumane killings. Besides,\\nadditional commercial and social pressure groups have emerged to make heavy demands\\non state policies. Multinational Corporations (MNCs) in America and Europe have become\\npowerful enough to dictate the economic policies of many poor states, whereas the influence\\nof non-governmental organisations (NGOs) on official policies is growing very fast.\\nMNCs are big business companies based in Europe or United States. They have\\nspread their business in consumer goods, drugs, etc. to most parts of the world. You\\nare familiar with Multinational Corporations like Coke, Microsoft, General Motors,\\netc. They make huge profits, and the annual turnover of some of the MNCs is higher\\nthan many less developed countries. NGOs are those bodies formed by individuals in\\ntheir private capacity without direct involvement or role of governments. YMCA,\\nRotary International, International Red Cross, are a few examples of thousands of\\nNGOs active today at local, national and international level. They work in the areas\\nof environment protection, development and human rights.\\nIn the light of realities, you may wonder how the situation could be described as world\\norder . No doubt, a lot is unsatisfactory , but it is also true that a lot more in world af fairs is'),\n",

For example, exchange of diplomats, rules regarding\\nwars, postal communication, air and sea traffic, treatment of foreigners, exchange of\\ncurrencies are part of international order . These and other aspects of international af fairs\\nare regulated through customs and traditions, and also by rules laid down in various\\ninternational agreements and treaties. It is also common that states having differences\\nseek the help of another country or an international agency for reaching a compromise.\\nThe talks currently in progress between India and Pakistan mirror these features of the\\nexisting world order . That a world war has not taken place after 1945 speaks about the\\npositive side of the world order .\\nLet us recognise that world order cannot be idealistic ignoring the realities completely .\\nPolitical and other conditions continuously influence the nature of the world order at any\\ntime. The world order in turn evolves gradually in response to these developments by\\nmaking necessary adjustments. The order does not completely break up to give place to a\\nnew order; it only makes changes as per the actual trends in the world. These changes\\nmay be good or bad, minor or major . In other words, major developments like the end of\\nthe Cold War necessitate change in the existing order , not change of the existing order .\\nIntext Questions 29.1\\n(1) Who are the main players in world affairs?\\n(2)Are states equal in their size and strength?\\n29.2 Bipolar  Order  during Cold War\\nAs you can imagine, Europe remained the theatre of world af fairs up to the Second World\\nWar. European countries maintained peace by forming alliances in order to ensure that no\\nsingle country (like France, Great Britain, Germany) could dominate the rest. The system\\nso prevailed was known as the balance of power . Britain mastered this policy for very\\nlong. However , the method collapsed in the beginning of the twentieth century with the\\nFirst World War. In the meanwhile, the rise of countries outside of Europe – such as the\\nUnited States and Japan – extended the nature and scope of world politics.\\nThe Second World War ended with the defeat of Germany , Japan and Italy in the hands of\\nthe alliance comprising mainly Great Britain, Soviet Russia and the United S tates of America.\\nIn the last stages of the war , the United S tates produced and dropped nuclear bombs on\\nthe Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The war had produced effects of long-\\nterm importance. The United States with its economic wealth and the military strength, no\\ndoubt, made a matchless contribution to the victory in the War. It was felt that the strengths\\nand leadership of the United S tates would be needed to maintain peace in the post-W ar\\nworld, too. Without surprise, Britain, France and other European countries became dependent\\non the United S tates for economic recovery and military security . Having contributed\\nsignificantly to the victory in the war , Soviet Russia was not to be sidelined; the country\\nclaimed equal say in deciding on European problems.\\nSoon after the Second World War, the erstwhile allies, viz. the United S tates and the\\nSoviet Union developed differences about working together for the peace and stability of\\nEurope. There were political and ideological reasons for these differences. The United\\nStates practised and preached democracy and free market enterprise as the desirable'),\n",

On the other hand the Soviet Union believed in and sought to spread\\nthe merits of governance by single (communist) party and of state-controlled economy .\\nThese dif ferences led to feelings of one being threatened by the other . So began the\\nbipolar phase in the world order immediately after the War. The United S tates and the\\nSoviet Union stood out as two opposite poles around which, to begin with, the European\\npolitics revolved. While the countries of Western Europe joined hands with the United\\nStates and called themselves the “Free World”, countries of Eastern Europe became part\\nof the Socialist camp led by the Soviet Union. These two leading countries of rival camps\\nwere clubbed under the exclusive, new category of “super powers”.\\nThe term “super powers” is distinct from the term “great powers”. Whereas the\\nworld identified only two countries, viz. the erstwhile Soviet Union and the United\\nStates as the super powers, the history of Europe records the existence of great\\npowers like Austria, Britain, France, Prussia, etc. The super powers individually\\npossessed military capabilities and economic resources far superior to other countries\\nin the rest of the world. With nuclear and other destructive weapons in their possession,\\nthey were able to influence events in many parts of the world and policies of many\\nother countries.\\nRelations between East and West were never cordial. Short of going to war directly , the\\ntwo camps indulged constantly in political and military competition. This state of affairs\\nwas widely called as the “Cold War”. The Cold War was marked by a great deal of\\ncompetition in forming military alliances, viz. the North Atlantic Treaty Or ganization (NA TO)\\nand the Warsaw Treaty Or ganization and the arms race through sophistication of nuclear\\nweapons.\\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Or ganization (NA TO) was formed in 1949 with the United\\nStates and Canada and 10 countries in Western Europe (like Belgium, Britain,\\nNetherlands, West Germany , etc.). NA TO members formed themselves as an alliance\\nto treat aggression against any one of them as aggression on all of them and fight the\\naggressor together . The Soviet Union then cleverly of fered to join the alliance. But\\nNATO turned down the of fer because NA TO’s real purpose was to stop the spread\\nof the Soviet influence and ideology . The Soviet Union set up in 1955 its own military\\ngrouping (called the Warsaw Treaty Or ganization) with its allies in Eastern Europe\\nto counter NA TO.\\nSoon the two Cold War rivals grudgingly acknowledged that each could destroy the other\\nin a nuclear confrontation many times over . In the face of such dangers, the bipolar relations\\nassumed new dimensions. On the one hand, the two camps got involved in local conflicts\\nin West Asia, South Asia, East Asia, Central America, and southern Africa. As a result a\\ngood deal of military “aid” flowed to the newly found or prospective allies. At the same\\ntime, attempts to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and deny their access to other\\ncountries started in 1960s.\\nThere were also some positive ef fects of the bipolar world order . Foremost, movements\\nfor independence from European colonial rule gained great momentum in Africa and Asia,\\nas both Cold War blocs feverishly encouraged the trend in order to gain goodwill of the\\nnative people. Beginning in 1960 nearly 100 new countries were born. However , these\\ncountries did not want to compromise on their newly won political freedom by joining this\\nor that military bloc. Hence they launched the “Non Aligned Movement” which tirelessly\\nadvocated world peace, nuclear disarmament, and economic advancement of the less'),\n",

Side by side, the clout of\\nthe oil-rich countries (in West Asia and elsewhere) asserted their importance by manipulated\\nproduction and price levels.\\nBy 1970s, significantly the bipolar world started yielding place to multipolarity .

The West European countries after enjoying the\\neconomic and military protection from the United States recovered as part of regional\\nintegration process known as the European Union. These countries have become a major\\ncompetitor for world markets to the United S tates. In East Asia too, economic rise of first\\nJapan and then China, followed by the Asian Tigers (like South Korea, Singapore, etc.)\\nloosened the grip of the bipolar world order . Interestingly , concerned over the challenge\\nfrom these new “poles”, the bipolar powers briefly tried reconciliation – known as “détente”\\n– during 1970s but they failed to sustain it. The bipolar world order continued till the totally\\nunexpected collapse of socialism in East Europe and the Soviet Union, which spelled\\nformal end to the Cold War era in the beginning of 1990s.\\nIntext Questions 29.2\\n(1) Name the victorious countries in the Second World War.\\n(2) Is it true that the importance of Europe declined after the Second World War?\\n(3) Which two countries were known as the super powers?\\n(4) Identify two military alliances formed during the Cold War era.\\n(5) Did the super powers attempt reconciliation?

Mobs in Poland, Hungary , Bulgaria and other countries\\nin Eastern Europe rose against socialist dictatorships and the regimes fell like a pack of\\ncards in quick succession, as the then Soviet Union under Michail Gorbachev’ s leadership\\nwas uninterested to militarily intervention. Soon the fever for freedom shook the master of\\nthe socialist camp itself. The Soviet Union broke up into Russian Federation and 14 other\\nRepublics in 1991. All these new states abandoned socialism and embraced Western\\nideology of democracy and free market economy . It was regarded as a grand victory for\\nthe United S tates. While Warsaw Treaty Or ganization was disbanded, the NA TO continues\\nand is engaged in military activities in Yugoslavia and Afghanistan, something not originally\\nplanned.\\nWith victory in the Cold War, the United S tates became an object of both admiration and\\nfear.

The United S tates has no\\nchallenger in claiming the top slot. The erstwhile enemy , the Soviet Union, is now an ally ,\\na partner of the United S tates in matters of arms control, international security , settlement\\nof regional conflicts, trade and investment. Despite occasional tensions, Europe is nowhere\\nnear challenging United S tates power .

The Nonaligned Movement has become less relevant.\\nMany socialist-oriented countries among the nonaligned too embraced free market ideology .\\nEconomies were liberalised to attract foreign/W estern investment. The role of International\\nMonetary Fund has become a key instrument of the United States in supervising the\\nadjustment process of these economies to market forces.\\nThe new power realities are aptly brought to bear in the functioning of the United Nations\\n– a body designed to work for democratic and just world order . The United Nations began\\nplaying “activist” role in restoring peace and security . The important security-related or gan,\\nthe Security Council earlier known for disagreements between the two super powers, is\\ntransformed into an active agent of the US while other permanent members either\\ncollaborated or looked the other way . Transparency and democratic functioning of the UN\\nsuffered. The role of the United Nations during the first Gulf War to vacate the Iraqi\\ninvasion of Kuwait in the early 1990s stands out as the best example of the new trend.\\nNearly a decade later , an impatient US invaded Iraq in 2003 unilaterally without caring for\\nthe United Nations.

Prior to 1990, territorial unity of countries was guaranteed as\\nan essential condition for stability . The Soviet disintegration encouraged demands for\\nseparate statehood based on ethnic, linguistic or religious identity .

East Timor is the latest in the list of territories that successfully\\nclaimed right to self-determination in a violent atmosphere. No one could say that worst is\\nover.\\nThe idea of “right to self-determination” aims to enable a population, under foreign\\noccupation or domination, to freely choose their own system of government. The\\nAmerican War of Independence and the French Revolution in the 18th century\\npromoted this idea. After the First World War, new states like Austria, Yugoslavia\\ncame into being by applying the right to self-determination in central Europe. After\\n1945, the colonized people in Africa, Asia and Caribbean successfully demanded the\\nright to self-determination to gain freedom from their colonial masters. Of late, some\\ndisgruntled groups (like in Kashmir) are interpreting the right to self-determination to\\nsecede or separate from the existing state. There are widespread fears that agreeing\\nto such demand would lead to break of many countries on ethnic, linguistic, religious\\nlines. It could even pose a major danger to the contemporary world order .\\nRegimes in many countries are fighting civil war against one or more rebel groups, and as\\na consequence state machinery has ceased to function or even exist in these unfortunate\\ncountries. Afghanistan, Angola, Burundi, Congo, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Somalia are among\\nthe victims of this kind of instability . Some of them have been branded as “failed states” –\\na source of worry to the rest of the world. At the same time some countries continued to\\nface threats of interference and military intervention from outside. The delicate situation\\nof Geor gia in Europe and Zaire in Africa illustrates this trend.\\nThe civil wars are being fought in the most brutal and uncivil fashion. Reports are available\\nabout reckless use of small arms (like AK-47s), hand grenades, and landmines, which\\nhave brought misery to the millions of unconnected and innocent men, women and children.\\nNearly 20 million lives were lost in violent clashes in the past 15 years. According to\\nestimates 95 out of a hundred deaths in these wars are innocent civilians. Clearing a city\\nor town of ethnic minority groups through mass killings, forcible use of children as soldiers,\\ngang rapes of women are key and inhumane features of the civil wars. Human rights\\nviolations by the official troops or rebels have now become a central concern for those\\ninterested in security and stability as components of the post-Cold War global order . The\\nfocus clearly shifted from the state security during the Cold War era to human security .\\nOn the other hand, a number of countries fear that human rights could be used as a pretext\\nfor foreign military interventions. In 2003 the United States invaded and occupied Iraq\\nafter accusing the regime of Saddam Hussein of using deadly weapons against Shia and\\nKurd sections of Iraqi population. A vast majority of countries criticised the US action as\\nillegal and unjustified, and also accused the US of misusing the human rights plank for its\\nown selfish interests. Ironically thousands of Iraqis and Americans lost – are losing – their\\nlives because of the continuing warfare between the American coalition and the Iraqi\\nresistance forces. There are apprehensions that the Iraqi venture could turn out as the\\nbiggest mistake of the United S tates comparable to its defeat in the war against Vietnam\\n(1963 – 73).\\nAmong other factors, religious intolerance is contributing to instability in the contemporary\\nworld. Though religious extremism is commonly identified with Islam, it is not true that it is\\nconfined to one religion alone. Many of these groups enjoy wide network of patronage\\ncutting across national boundaries encompassing supply of military hardware and funds.'),\n",

Al Qaeda under the\\nleadership of Osama bin Laden is one of the most feared terrorist organisations in the\\nworld today . We all are familiar with the daredevil attacks planned and or ganised allegedly\\nby Osama bin Laden’ s followers against the World Trade Center in New York and other\\nlocations in the United S tates on 1 1 September 2001. Although terrorism as a menace\\nexisted much before 1 1 September 2001, the incident demonstrated on the television screens\\nhow the mightiest power on earth was so easily shaken. In South Asia, India and Sri\\nLanka have been fighting terrorists for more than a decade. And now terrorism has spread\\nto other countries like Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan in South Asia, Malaysia and Indonesia\\nin Southeast Asia, Palestine, Lebanon and Egypt in West Asia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan in\\nAfrica and so forth. In a shocking incident in September 2004, Chechnya-associated\\nterrorists seized a school in southern Russia and in an unfortunate showdown with Russian\\ncommandos caused death to 350 young school children.\\nIn short, these aspects of instability point to the need to look at security in a new way . The\\nscope of security has expanded; it includes not only absence of foreign aggression but also\\ninternal stability . Security does not just mean building up strong military force to protect\\nstate; it has to ensure economic, social, environmental well being of people.

The\\nend of the Cold War and near universal adoption of privatisation and economic liberalisation\\nas the only route to growth and development served as the right setting for significant\\nchanges in the conduct of economic or business transactions during the 1990s. There\\nwere other developments, which contributed to the deepening of globalisation. Advances\\nin information and communication technology that are associated with use of computer\\nand internet have heralded the “electronic age”. Along with the existing financial institutions\\nof the world like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank whose power and\\nreach now have become global, an equally powerful new organization dedicated to promotion\\nof free trade has come into being. It is the World Trade Or ganisation. The whole world\\nhas become a single market allowing foreign investments and free flow of goods across\\nnational boundaries. In the new climate, multinational corporations have gained global\\nrespect and access.'),\n",

Private\\nfirms can invest and disinvest at will, locate production centres at a profit yielding or cost\\nreducing anywhere in the world, hire employees of foreign origin on cheaper rates, assign\\nwork to far away people with the desired skills and experience, and flood markets in the\\ndeveloping countries with consumer and other goods for sale at rates competitive to local\\nproducts, and safely take back profits. All this is happening with the help of technology\\naccess to which is not yet universal or equal. The globalisation process as manifested in\\nthe activities of multinational corporations, media giants and non-governmental organisations\\nhas considerably undermined the sovereign prerogatives of the state structures in the\\nThird World. Territorial borders identified with nation states have become less ef fective to\\ncheck ill effects of globalisation.\\nThe bulk of the world community – the developing countries - has become part of\\nglobalisation with great hope. Let us look at India’ s experience. With strengths like well\\ndeveloped and highly competitive computer software industry , the availability of technical\\nand skilled work force and its potential as a very large middle class market, India has\\nhopes to benefit in the era of globalisation. Since 1991, India changed the orientation of its\\neconomic policy by injecting pronounced features of privatization, liberalisation of rules\\nfor foreign investment, and disinvestment of public sector companies. Customers are\\nflooded with an amazing choice of goods in the market – from motor cars to food products.\\nIndia’ s exports have gone up especially in service sector , investments have come into the\\ncountry , and our foreign exchange reserves are extremely comfortable. Overall, India\\nduring globalisation has emerged as one of the fastest growing economies in the world.\\nThough India is open to beneficial aspects of globalisation, it is concerned over the adverse\\neffects. American companies, currency , TV channels and weapons have taken over the\\nworld. Many local companies are being shut down causing unemployment to millions even\\nin the advanced countries. Withdrawal of Governmental support through subsidies in\\nfertilizers, electricity and other essential needs has added to the misery of rural and farming\\nsections.

Germany , Japan, and Italy)\\nin the Second World War, the allied powers led by the USA, former Soviet Union and the\\nUK started planning an organization in place of the League of Nations. The US president,\\nRoosevelt and the British Prime Minister , Winston Churchill signed the Atlantic Charter in\\nAugust 1941 indicating their desire for a post-war peace institution. Then, a series of\\nconferences followed at Moscow , Teheran, Dumbarton Oaks and Yalta to discuss various\\nideas and proposals. Finally , the Unite d States hosted the San Francisco Conference in\\nearly 1945 to finalise and sign the Charter of the new organisation, the ‘United Nations’.\\nThe United Nations was established on 24th October 1945. Since then, we celebrate\\n24th October as UN Day .\\nThe Charter is the Constitution of the United Nations. It lists the purposes of the organization,\\nthe principles guiding the conduct of both the United Nations and its member countries, the\\nprincipal organs along with t heir composition and powers.\\n30.1.1 Purposes and Principles\\nThe Charter indicates, at the very beginning, four broad objectives of the United Nations.\\nThey are\\n(i) to maintain international peace and security through collective measures for\\nsuppression of aggression and through peaceful settlement of disputes;\\n(ii) to develop friendly relations among countries based on full respect for the principle\\nof equality and self-determination;\\n(iii) to achieve international cooperation in the economic, social, cultural or humanitarian\\nfields, and\\n(iv) to encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.\\nIn pursuit of the above objectives, both the United Nations and its member states are\\nrequired to adhere to a set of important guiding principles. The foremost among them is\\nthe principle of equality among countries whether big or small, strong or weak. The United\\nNations will not interfere in the domestic matters of the member countries.\\nThe member states of the United Nations are expected to resolve their disp utes with\\nother states in a peaceful manner without endangering international peace and security .\\nFurther , the member states should refrain from threats or use of force against another\\nmember . It is the duty of the members to assist the United Nations in the enforcement\\nof peace.\\nAs we have already noted, the maintenance of international peace and security is a very\\nimportant purpose of the UN. Other purposes are complementary to the purpose of peace.\\nIn discussing the role of the UN, we should bear in mind one basic aspect of the world\\nbody: it is a political body serving its member governments in the  context of global politics.\\nNeither the preferences of governments, nor the trends in international politics are\\nstatic; they change from time to time. Hence, in the exercise of its powers, the UN\\ncannot be rigid, mechanical or uniform. The role of the UN is marked, therefore, by\\nflexibility and pragmatism. Generally , the UN preferred not to take a harsh view or\\ncondemn the aggressor country whenever it received complaints on a breach of peace.\\nInstead, it directed its efforts to stop the fighting immediately and to seek withdrawal of\\ntroops to pre-war locations.'),\n",

The principles of\\nsovereign equality and universality are embodied in its composition. All members of the\\nUnited Nations (presently191) are members of the General Assembly . Irrespective of size\\nor strength, every member has one vote in the Assembly . A vote cast by the United S tates,\\nfor example, is equivalent to the vote of Bhutan or Cuba.

It can discuss any\\nmatter . It discusses matters which include peace and security questions, environmental\\nprotection, economic development, problems of colonial administration, disarmament,\\nrefugees, population explosion, use of global commons like outer space and deep seaboard.\\nIt can only make recommendations. As part of this function, the Assembly has adopted a\\nnumber of important declarations containing principles of international cooperation in political,\\neconomic, social and other matters. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948),\\nthe Declaration on Decolonisation (1960), Declaration on New International Economic\\nOrder (1974), Declaration on Rights of the Child (1989), Declaration on International\\nTerrorism (1994) are only a few examples. They are common goals desirable for\\ngovernments to implement in their national policies and programmes. The Declarations\\nare not binding on countries. Yet, they carry great moral and political weight. Therefore,\\ngovernments find it difficult to ignore them.\\nThe Assembly has also adopted several laws like the covenant on civil, political, economic\\nrights of individuals, the laws of exploitation of seas, laws prohibiting or controlling chemical\\nand biological weapons, and so on. These laws are not like the laws of our Parliament\\nwhich are automatically binding on all of us whereas these international laws and conventions\\nare legally binding only on those states that agree to comply with them. The Assembly\\nelects members of various organs. It appoints the Secretary General. It supervises the\\nwork of the Economic and Social Council, the Security Council, the Trusteeship Council\\nand other bodies. The Assembly has the power to approve the budget of the United Nations\\nand to apportion the amount among all the member countries.\\n30.2.2 The Security Council\\nThe Security Council is the most powerful decision-making body of the United Nations. It\\nhas the main responsibility to maintain international peace and security . The Council is a\\ncontrast from the General Assembly , in respect of both its composition and the decision-\\nmaking procedure. Unlike the Assembly , the membership of the Council is limited to 15\\ncountries only , out of which five are permanent members. These five countries are China,\\nFrance, Russia, the UK and the USA. The remaining ten members- called non-permanent\\nmembers are elected by the General Assembly for a term of two years. They represent\\ndifferent geographical regions of the world like Asia, Africa, Latin America, Western and\\nEastern Europe. It was initially hoped that its small size could make it easy for the Council\\nto take decisions on procedural matters by nine affirmative votes (simple majority). On\\nsubstantive questions, the nine affirmative votes should include concurring vote of the\\npermanent members. In other words, the Council cannot take decisions of major significance\\nif any one of the five permanent members casts a negative vote. This special privilege of\\nthe permanent members is popularly known as the veto power . To abstain from voting in\\nthe Security Council is not veto. The veto provision has faced criticism from the very\\nbeginning. The veto power dilutes the principle of sovereign equality of member countries.\\nVeto: The five permanent members of the UN have power or privilege to cast a\\nnegative vote on substantive questions or matters. This privilege is known as veto\\npower .\\nThe power and functions of the Security Council are limited to the task of maintenance of\\ninternational peace and security . In case, a dispute arises between two or more countries\\nthe Council can make appropriate recommendations in the interest of peaceful settlement\\nof the dispute. Nevertheless, these recommendations are not binding on the unwilling'),\n",

For examp le, on the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, the Security Council resolutions\\nare not legally binding on either India or Pakistan unless both countries willingly accept\\nthem. The Council can use extraordinary power to deal with wars or threats of war\\nbetween countries. In such an event, the Council can determine who the aggressor is and\\ncan call for necessary steps to restore peace. These steps may include, at the discretion of\\nthe Council, economic sanctions like freezing of assets abroad, banning of exports and\\nimports, or military action by land, sea or air . Notably , whenever the Security Council\\ntakes such steps, they are binding not only on the states directly involved in the war but\\nalso on all members of the United Nations. Once, the Security Council takes a decision, it\\nis the duty of the member countries to carry out decisions. Obviously , the Council can take\\nsuch important decisions only with the agreement among the permanent members. In the\\nrecent years, after the end of the cold war , the Council has frequently used its binding\\npowers to deal with various problems of international peace and security . The role of the\\nSecurity Council in discharging its functions depends on the specific circumstances of\\neach case and the existence of broad agreement among the five permanent members. It\\nis important to note that the Security Council has imposed varying sets of economic and\\ndiplomatic sanctions against 25 countries so far . These sanctions included cutting of f\\ndiplomatic relations, stopping of oil imports and exports, banning weapons supplies, freezing\\nof assets abroad, etc. Haiti, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, South Africa were among the tar gets of\\nthese sanctions. Since no armed forces are placed under the UN to fight an aggressor\\neven after five decades of the Charter ’s commitment to it, it has requested member countries\\nto contribute towards such a force to take military action for restoring peace. The UN\\nauthorized military action to push North Korean forces from South Korea in 1950 and Iraq\\nfrom Kuwait in 1990. Notability in a recent case, the Council refused to authorize the US\\nwar against Iraq. Therefore, the US war on Iraq (2003) was illegal. The Security Council\\nsends soldiers of member countries to a troubled area, with the agreement of the\\ngovernments concerned, to bring calm and normalcy . This lar gely successful activity is\\nknown as ‘peace ke eping operations’.\\n30.2.3 The Economic and Social Council\\nThe Economic and Social Council works to promote international cooperation in economic\\nand social fields. It comprises 54 members all of whom are elected for a term of three\\nyears by the General Assembly , giving representation to various geographical regions.\\nDecisions are taken by a simple majority of members present and voting. It considers\\ninternational economic, social, cultural and humanitarian problems. The Council has set up\\ncommissions to study and advise on the status of women, population, human rights, etc. It\\nhas the power to coordinate the activities of various specialized agencies like the International\\nLabour Or ganisation, the World Health Or ganisation etc. (which are discussed in a separate\\nlesson in this book). Another important function of the Council is to bring Non-Governmental\\nOrganizations (NGOs) to take part in its deliberations. The powers of the Council are\\nquite modest as compared to its responsibilities. By means of study , discussion and\\ncoordination, the Council is expected to promote full employment, higher standards of\\nliving and solution of internationa l economic and social problems.\\n30.2.4 The Trusteeship Council\\nThe Trusteeship Council was created to supervise the working of the international trusteeship\\nsystem.

Most parts of Africa and Asia were not\\nfree in 1945 when the United Nations was set up. For UN, ending colonial rule became\\nessential for achieving world peace and progress. Freeing millions of people from foreign\\ncolonial rule is a historic achievement of the UN. The UNs anti-colonial territories covered\\ntwo categories of dependent population. They were the trust territories for which UN was\\ndirectly responsible. Then there were several territories administered by western colonial\\npowers like Britain, France, etc. ‘T rust’ territories were placed under the responsibility of\\nthe UN until the people of the territories concerned would be able to determine freely their\\nfuture status. Cameroon, Nauru, New Guinea, the Pacific Islands, Rwanda-Urundi,\\nSomaliland, Tanganyika, Togoland were among them. By 1994 all trust territories became\\nfree with the help provided by the UN. Seven have become independent and four chose to\\nmerge with the neighbouring countries. The UN interest in the liberation for subject people\\nextended beyond trust territories. Its built up this campaign against colonialism was the\\nadoption of the Declaration of Decolonisation by the General Assembly in 1960, demanding\\nimmediate independence of all colonial territories and populations. Since that time, 60\\nterritories have become free under the sustained pressure built in the UN. Namtria, Eritrea,\\nEast Timor are among the recent examples of successful fight against colonialism. There\\nare now only very few like western Sahara waiting to exercise their free choice. There is\\nsome confusion that the fight against colonialism blesses the right of some disgruntled\\npeople to separate from their newly formed independent state. Right to ‘self-determination’\\napplies to people under foreign colonial rule only .\\nThe UN opposition to racism in South Africa known as apartheid-is also remarkable. The\\norganizations interest in the matter dates back to early 1946. South African white minority\\nregime did not pay heed to the gentle pleas by the UN. Later pressure was built to force\\nwhite South Africa government to end its policy of discrimination against the Black\\npopulation. South African teams were passed to participate in international sports events.\\nThe Security Council joined the ef fort later by banning arms sales. South Africa felt the\\nheat and agreed to end its policy in 1993. The widely respected black leader , Nelson\\nMandela was released after 27 years of imprisonment. The apartheid laws were revoked.\\nInternationally supervised free elections were held, leading to the installation of a government\\nunder President Mandela in 1994. Soon after wards, the UN revoked all previous\\npunishments and restored to the new South Africa its rightful place in the world body .\\n30.4 Promotion of Human Rights\\nPromotion of human rights culture through world wide human rights standards has been\\nanother major contribution of the United Nations. Nearly 80 declarations and conventions\\ntouching upon various facets of human rights have been adopted by the UN in the past\\nfive decades.\\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights was the first among the UN declarations.\\nThe day of its adoption-10 December 1948 is observed every year as the Human Rights\\nday. The Declaration contains a broad range of civil, political, economic, social and cultural\\nrights that all people are entitled to, without any discrimination. Admittedly , the Universal\\nDeclaration, as any declaration, is not binding on governments. However , it gave inspiration'),\n",

Both these covenants became applicable to the\\nsignatory states from 1976 onwards. These two covenants, together with the universal\\ndeclaration, are known as ‘the International Bill of Rights’.\\nThe covenant on economic, social and cultural rights highlights the right to work in just\\ncondition, the right to adequate standard of living and the right to social protection. The\\nCovenant on civil and political rights emphasizes freedom of movement, equality before\\nthe law , freedom of religion, freedom of participation in elections, and protection of minority\\nrights. A specially constituted committee monitors the compliance of the signatory states\\nto this covenant on HR. A remarkable feature is the UN is empowered under the civil and\\npolitical rights covenant to receive and redress complaints from individuals against the\\nbehavior of their own respective governments.\\nThe UN has adopted other declarations and covenants with the aim of stopping the practice\\nof torture and racial discrimination or protecting vulnerable section like children, women\\nand migrant workers\\nThe activities of the UN include the convening of periodical conferences on human rights.\\nRecently , in 1993 the UN or ganized at Vienna an international conference on Human\\nrights. Acting upon the recommendations of the conference, the General Assembly appointed\\nin 1994 the UN high commissioner for HR whose task is to promote more scrupulous\\nrespect for human rights throughout the world.\\n30.5 Need for  Re-S tructuring The United Nation\\nAlthough the United Nations has done a responsible job there are some obstacles which\\nlimit its performance. For example, a few organs of the United Nations have not changed,\\nthough the changes in the world around require it. Let us look at the Security Council as an\\nexample. Unlike the General Assembly; the permanent membership of the Security Council\\nis limited to 15 countries only . Out of that, P-5 (China, France, Russia, UK and USA) are\\npermanent. They were given permanent status in 1945 due to some historical and political\\nreasons. The remaining ten members are non-permanent members elected by the General\\nAssembly for a term of two years. This arrangement is six decades old, when most of\\nAfrica and Asian countries were not part of the United Nations. Now with membership of\\nthe world body rising by four times, the council’ s composion needs to be suitably changed.\\nThere is a strong case to add a few countries like India as permanent members. The\\nmember of non-permanent members should also be increased so that different countries\\ncan get a feeling that the Council works for their future. The Third World countries are of\\nthe opinion that United Nations is an agent of Western countries especially the United\\nStates. To correct this image, the number of Permanent members has to be increased.\\nJapan, India, Germany , Brazil and Nigeria are the claimant for it. Japan and Germany are\\nno longer enemy states and because of their economic strength and contribution to the UN\\nbudget are considered as the most eligible for permanent membership of the Security\\nCouncil. India’ s contribution in several UN Peacekeeping forces and its active role in\\npeace making processes facilitates its obvious claim to be a permanent member of the\\nCouncil. India has been a founder member of the United Nations. Besides India is the\\nsecond largest populous country and is the largest democracy in the world.'),\n",

Without peace, it is\\nvery difficult to achieve other goals like economic and social progress.

Moreover , a number of countries and their\\npeople are experiencing the negative effects of wars. Hence, leaders of the world joined\\nhands to prevent war and to manage the peaceful relations among the nations. That is the\\nreason why the United Nations was created at the end of Second World War. The United\\nNations was created to work for peace in all parts of the world. In fact, peace is its top\\nmost aim. United Nations is today the most important organisation dedicated to world\\npeace. Many organs of the United Nations work for peace. The efforts of Security Council,\\nthe General Assembly and the Secretary General are notable. There have been more than\\n300 wars after the Second World War.

Its organs work to\\nprevent wars from happening. This is done by advising or encouraging countries to maintain\\nfriendliest relations without interfering in each other ’s affairs and to settle dif ferences\\nwithout using force. For this purpose United Nations has passed several Declarations and\\nResolutions. They are not of course binding on member countries, yet they have moral\\nweight. However , regrettably , countries went to wars. On such occasions the United\\nNations worked hard to stop such wars as quickly as possible. For example, when India\\nand Pakistan fought a war over Jammu and Kashmir in 1947, United Nations successfully\\npersuaded both countries to stop that war . On the other hand, United Nations activities\\nrecognised need to strengthen conditions of peace through control or elimination of dangerous\\nweapons. There are four main aspects of the United Nations activities which have made\\nour world somewhat peaceful. They are : (1) mediation activities to help countries to\\nreach an agreement, without using armed forces; (2) Peacekeeping activities to keep\\nwarring nations apart and restore peace without firing a shot; (3) Permitting some member\\ncountries to forcibly intervene in a troubled area and restore peace in an area;\\n(4) Disarmament activities aimed at reducing or totally prohibiting tools of war like landmines,\\nchemical weapons etc. It is important to learn more about each of these four peace activities\\nof the United Nations.\\n31.2 Mediation Activities\\nThe United Nations has played the role of mediator in dozens of conflicts, sometimes\\nsuccessfully and at other times not so successfully .\\nMediation is an activity undertaken by a country or an organization or individual to\\nhelp resolve a problem. The mediator is not directly connected to the dispute or\\nproblem. The mediator has to be friendly and impartial with the quarrelling countries.\\nThe mediation starts only when parties to a problem agree. The mediator aims to\\nbring parties face to face for talks or help them in identifying areas of agreement. It\\nis a painstaking and skilled job for which United Nations has gained much experience.\\nThe UN Security Council sent mediators in 1950s to solve the Kashmir problem amicably\\nbut t he efforts were not fruitful. The Cuban Missile crisis of 1962 is a good example\\nwhere the Secretary General U Thant’ s mediation helped to avoid direct military\\nconfrontation between the United States and the former Soviet Union. In 1987, United\\nNations successfully , mediated to get an accord signed for the withdrawal of Soviet troops\\nfrom Afghanistan. Similar mediation was undertaken successfully on Cambodia problem\\nin 1991. There are nearly two dozen UN mediators presently helping resolution of problems\\nin Somalia, Cyprus, Western Sahara etc.\\nThe United Nations also helped in fact finding or impartial investigations into border violations,\\nuse of banned weapons, and other complaints. With regards to Arab-Israeli conflict, United\\nNations suggested in 1967 an outline for a settlement that recognised the rights of both\\nIsrael and Palestine to live in secure boundaries. At times, the judicial or gan, the World\\nCourt also contributed to peace through its judgements on complaints brought before it by\\ncountries. For example in 2003 the Court ruled against Israel’ s construction of a wall in\\noccupied Palestinian t erritories as illegal and provocative. The General Assembly later\\ncalled upon Israel to adhere to the Court’ s opinion.'),\n",

It does not mean that United Nations cannot do, or has not\\ndone, any thing in case countries ignore the advice of the United Nations and become a\\nthreat to world peace. As you have already learnt in lesson 30, the Security Council has\\nthe power to impose ‘sanctions’ against a threatening country or government so that peace\\nis restored without the need for armed/military action. These ‘non-military sanctions’,\\nwhen decided by the Security Council are to be compulsorily implemented by all member\\ncountries of the United Nations.\\n‘Sanctions’ are strong steps taken to isolate and punish a country that becomes a menace\\nto peace. Sanctions do not mean use of military force. Security Council’ s non-military\\nsanctions could mean cutting off of diplomatic relations between the targeted country and\\nthe rest of the word, curbing sale of arms and ammunition, banning imports and exports of\\nany and all items like oil, medicines etc., freezing of bank deposits in foreign countries.\\nThese steps are aimed to ensure that the tar get country stops its objectionable activity .\\nUnited Nations has imposed the binding non-military sanctions some 25 times so far . One\\nof the first cases of such sanctions occurred a gainst South Africa. South Africa refused to\\nabide by the repeated advice of the international community to end its policy of racial\\ndiscrimination against the Blacks, the Indians and coloured people residing in that country .\\nA compulsory ban on supply of weapons was imposed in 1977 to compel South Africa to\\nend its policy of racial discrimination. Other methods like banning from international sports\\nwere also used. South Africa finally had to bow to the wishes of the world when it ended\\nits racial discrimination- apartheid - in 1994. In one of the remarkable instances, United\\nNations imposed wide ranging sanctions against Iraq which attacked and occupied\\nneighbouring Kuwait in 1990. Sale and purchase of oil was prohibited, food and other\\nessential needs were denied, communication and transport links were cut and accounts in\\nforeign banks were sealed. These actions had a major impact on Iraq and its people for a\\nvery long time. Similarly United Nations launched sanctions against many terrorist\\norganisations to deny them any funding. This step was taken after the terrorist attacks\\nagainst the United S tates of American in September 1 1, 20 01. Let us however , remember\\nthat United Nations sanctions against wrong doers have not achieved the desired results\\nalways. It seems terrorists continue to get funds secretly inspite of sanctions.\\nIntext Questions 31.1\\nTrue or False :\\n1.

For this purpose, United Nations was to be equipped\\nwith a standing army consisting of troops, contributed by member countries. This\\narmydesigned to fight aggressor countries under the control of the United Nations and its\\nSecretary General - could not become a reality . The strong countries like United S tates\\nand the then Soviet Union had serious disagreements on the matter . Hence, even after\\nmore than five decades of its existence, the United Nations does not have its own military\\nforce to take military action against an aggressor country . Because of this limitation United\\nNations could not take military action against invading countries independently or\\nautomatically .\\nMoreover due to the cold war between the United States and the former Soviet Union,\\nthe members of the United Nations could not reach to an agreement on identifying the\\naggressor . Often, the two cold war rivals which are permanent members of the Security\\nCouncil supported the parties to the dispute and prevented action against their allies with\\nthe help of veto power . Thus the Security Council remained deadlocked most of the time\\nduring the cold war . And yet the UN authorised or permitted one or groups of member\\ncountries to take military action on its behalf. Though less than satisfactory , this was a\\npractical option exercised on occasions such as Korea in 1950.\\nUnited Nations authorised military action happened in 1950 after North Korea armed\\nforces crossed over to South Korea and refused to go back. The United States was willing\\nand prepared to get militarily involved, along with its allies to defend South Korea, for its\\nown reasons. The United Nations simply endorsed the American intention and authorised\\na military action to push back North Korea from the territory of South Korea. The United\\nStates, using the UN flag, somehow succeeded in restoring South Korea’ s freedom from\\nNorth Korean invasion.\\nNearly forty years later , United Nations got another opportunity to give similar authorisation\\nto the United States and its allies to use military force to push Iraqi army out of Kuwait.\\nThus followed the first Gulf war in 1991. It ended with the defeat of Iraq. It is important to\\nremember that the US led Gulf war was the first major war in the new era after the cold\\nwar ended.\\nThe end of the US-Soviet cold war was widely expected to help positively the United\\nNations activities for peace. Unfortunately , those activities came completely under the\\nshadow of the United States. United Nations could not act ignoring the preferences and\\nprejudices of the US which became militarily the strongest country after the cold war . In\\nthe midst of new threats to peace like civil or ethnic wars in Liberia, Somalia, Former\\nYugoslavia, United Nations turned to United S tates or its allies to send troops. On ten\\noccasions, UN authorised use of force after the first Gulf war . United S tates was permitted\\nto lead multinational military forces in Somalia (1992), Bosnia (1993), Haiti (1994) and\\nLiberia (2003). Besides, Australia and France also got UN permission to send forces to\\nrestore order in East Timor and Rwanda respectively . Nevertheless, many questions have\\ncome up about the wisdom of such military activities. Indeed the fair name of the United\\nNations has been affected. Therefore, United Nations is more cautious to allow military\\naction under its name. The United Nations refused to grant US request for permission to'),\n",

It is different matter that United States went\\nahead with its war plans without having the benefit of UN permission.\\n31.5 Peacekeeping Activities\\nCompared to the military authorisations, peacekeeping is a remarkable contribution of the\\nUnited Nations towards world peace. This important activity , in fact, was not anticipated\\nwhen the United Nations was founded. However , UN tried with this technique right from\\nits early years. The first UN peacekeeping activity started in 1948 when UN dispatched a\\nsmall team of military observers to ensure peace after the first Arab-Israeli war . Since\\nthen, in all there have been 60 peacekeeping operations dispatched by United Nations to\\nrestore or maintain peace in countries located in four continents -Africa, Asia, Europe and\\nSouth America. Two such operations restored peace between India and Pakistan.\\nUnited Nations Military Observer Groups in India and Pakistan (UNOGIP) was\\nestablished in January 1949 after the major conflict between the two countries over\\nKashmir issue The observers are continuing to the present time. United Nations\\nIndia Pakistan Observation Mission (UNIPOM) was established in September 1965\\nafter the war between India and Pakistan and continued until March 1966.\\nIn UN peacekeeping activity there are some notable turning points. For example, in 1956,\\na 6,000 strong force called United Nations Emergency Force could arrange, without firing\\na shot, withdrawal of foreign troops from Egypt. In 1960 a much larger peacekeeping\\nforce ensured that a newly independent country remained secure from foreign intervention\\nand internal disintegration. In 1993, an equally big operation took over administration of\\nCambodia and installed democratically elected government there. The end of cold war in\\n1990 witnessed rapid rise in the number of peacekeeping activities launched. Some were\\nvery successful, while others faced difficulties. The examples of failed peacekeeping\\noperations were in former Yugoslavia, Somalia and Rwanda. The over all worth of the UN\\npeacekeeping was demonstrated when in 1988 this activity received Nobel peace prize.\\nUntied Nations Peacekeeping operations consist of impartial military and civilian\\npersonnel from different countries working under the UN command. Their main job\\nis to nonviolently stop the warring countries from fighting and help them observe the\\ncease-fire agreement reached between them. They create an atmosphere for the\\nwarring nations could resolve their differences. Usually they are sent to help control\\nand resolve conflict between hostile states and sometimes between hostile communities\\nwithin a single state. The UN peacekeeping forces carry light arms and are allowed\\nto use minimum force only if they are attacked.\\nIntext Questions 31.2\\nFill in the blanks :\\n1.

Far from securing peace these weapons have\\nmade the world a dangerous place to live in. Nuclear and other dangerous weapons threaten\\nthe very survival of mankind. If full-fledged nuclear war breaks out, it is not only the\\npopulation of the warring countries that would die but also the rest of the population spread\\nover the globe would suf fer. Those who survive the nuclear war would die a slow and\\npainful death. Thus, the preservation of life on the planet is the first and foremost\\nconsideration for disarmament. Equally important, disarmament offers the possibility of\\ndiverting huge funds from the arms production for improving the living conditions of the\\npoor and needy people of the world.\\nRight from the inception, the United Nations has taken active interest in disarmament.\\nSeveral disarmament treaties resulted from UN efforts. Some of them are no doubt\\ncontroversial. For example Treaty on the Non-proliferation (NPT) of Nuclear Weapons of\\n1968. This treaty required non-nuclear states not to acquire nuclear weapons, while leaving\\nthe nuclear weapon powers free to increase their stocks. Many countries like India refused\\nto sign the treaty to protest against the discrimination.\\nThe UN General Assembly convened three special sessions to focus world attention on\\nthe need for disarmament. Those sessions, mobilised world opinion to press reduction of\\nnuclear and convertional weapons. But no concrete results were evident, because of cold\\nwar tensions.\\nThe ending of the Cold War raised hopes of serious moves to control and reduce nuclear\\nand other weapons of mass destructions (WMDs). The General Assembly adopted a text\\nof resolution of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) in September 1996. The\\nchances of CTBT coming into force are considered remote because many countries,\\nincluding India, described it a defective treaty and refused to sign it until the five nuclear\\npowers had disarmed.\\nOn the positive side, UN efforts in disarmament led to banning of landmines (1997) and\\nprohibition and destruction of existing stocks of chemical weapons under international\\nsupervision (1993). UN also made progress in actually removing several lakhs of landmines\\nin Asia and Africa, supervising elimination of existing stocks of chemical weapons. Also\\nUN played its part in destruction of chemical and biological weapons of Iraq in 1990s.\\nIntext Questions 31.3\\nFill in the blanks :\\n1.

Since 1960\\neconomic and social development of the newly independent, poor countries has been the\\nmain preoccupation of the United Nations.

With the help of their growing majority in the United\\nNations they were able to create new agencies. The United Nations launched the First\\nDevelopment Decade. In 1960s international institutions like the UN Development\\nProgramme. UN Industrial Development Organisation, International Development\\nAssociation were get up in 1960s.\\nAt the initiative of developing countries United Nations Conference on Trade and\\nDevelopment (UNCT AD) was formed in 1964 to promote international trade for the benefit\\nof developing countries.

WHO’ s has been a clearing\\nhouse for scientific knowledge and a exchange of information for curing disease. WHO’ s\\nactivity in the area of preventing the outbreak of disease is to facilitate the exchange of\\nfindings and promotion of research. It has encouraged research with cheap preventatives,\\nespecially vaccines for tuberculosis a nd DDT for malaria. The campaign against malaria\\nhas been one of WHO’ s biggest all-out programme. Since heterosexual transmission of\\nthe human immune deficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS is becoming the predominant\\nmode of spread of HIV in most countries of the world, WHO is engaged in research for\\nvaccine to cure AIDS for which it needs necessary financial support from rich member\\ncountries to meet the challenge of this deadly disease.\\nA very important WHO programme is Polio Eradication Immunization.

He is the chief representative of\\nthe government in the district. The office is the result of a long process of evolution. Since\\n1772 when the office of district collector was created during the British regime, at that\\ntime, he performed activities chiefly related to collection of land revenue, maintenance of\\nlaw and order , prevention of disorder , proper working of the police and jails, administration\\nof criminal justice and exercised appellate powers in some cases besides those to try\\ncases of special importance.\\nThe office of the district collector ‘Admirably survive the historic role of change from\\nalien regime to a national one’. Since independence, its role has become increasingly\\nmultidimensional. He belongs to the Indian administrative service. Article 50 of the\\nconstitution separates the judiciary from the executive. There are now separate judicial\\nofficers in the district and, therefore the collector no longer holds the same judicial authority\\nas he did earlier as a District Magistrate. Though, a lot has been said about the developmental\\nrole of the Collector , the sad truth is that democratic decentralization in the form of\\nPanchayati Raj which preceded this role has curtailed his powers drastically in some\\nstates. The Zilla Parishads, particularly , have emer ged as separate centers of power , largely\\nindependent of the collector . The emer gence of several technical departments like labour ,\\nagriculture, cooperatives etc are now controlled by a host of executive officers directly at\\nthe state level, which has led to the reduction of the collector ’s authority . Some of the\\ntechnical departments are headed by specialists and are relatively independent of the\\ncollector . He has to deal with many political leaders and political parties which have enhanced\\nhis responsibilities.\\n34.8.1 Role and Functions of District Collector\\nRevenue Functions :\\nDistrict Collector is the head of the revenue administration of the district. His foremost\\ntask is the assessment and collection of land revenue.\\nIn this, he performs the following functions:\\n1. to collect land revenue.\\n2. to collect other government dues.\\n3. to distribute and recover taccavi  * loans.\\n4. to maintain land records.\\n5. to collect rural statistics.\\n6. to exercise the power of land acquisition of ficer, i.e. acquiring land for purpose of\\ncolonization, industry , slum clearance etc.\\n7. to implement land reforms.\\n8. to look after the welfare of the agriculturists.\\n9. to make an assessment of losses of crops and recommend relief during natural\\ncalamities like fire, draught and flood etc.'),\n",

These advances or loans of money is given\\nat the time of sowing or in a bad season or to enable them to extend their cultivation. This\\nloan has to be repaid when the crop is harvested.\\nAgricultural loans are distributed by the collector and his staff, relief works have to be\\ntaken up on a very extensive scale in case of a famine, floods etc. Land acquisition is\\nanother major responsibility of the collector . Due to various development projects, housing\\nschemes, slum clearance etc, land has to be acquired for public purposes. The collector is\\nresponsible for this acquisition. He also maintains proper land records. He is responsible\\nnot only for the maintenance of these records but also their revision from time to time. He\\nis the manager of government estates, government land, forests, water ways etc. In the\\ndistrict lastly , he also hears appeals in revenue cases against the orders of lower courts.\\nThe revenue work is a colossal task in itself and therefore, there are many subordinate\\nofficers to assist him. In some of the states like Andhra Pradesh, another IAS of ficer\\ndesignated as the district revenue officer is appointed to assist the collector in his revenue\\nwork.\\n34.8.2 Maintenance of Law and Order\\nIn this capacity he is responsible for the maintenance of law and order in his district. Three\\nelements are involved i.e. – the police, the judiciary and the jails. As District Magistrate, he\\nperforms the following functions :\\n1. To control and supervise the subordinate magistracy .\\n2. In case of threat to public peace, to order imposition under section 144 of the criminical\\nprocedure code.\\n3. To inspect the jails.\\n4. To release prisoners on parole.\\n5. To grant superior classes to prisoners.\\n6. To submit an annual criminal report to the govt.\\n7. To grant, suspend or cancel many kinds of licenses like arms, hotels, explosives etc.\\n8. To control and direct the action of district police.\\n9.

To recommend schemes for the development of forests.\\n13. To supervise and control local bodies.\\nHe also acts in many ways as an agent of the judiciary . The executions of writs of the civil\\nand criminal courts, including criminal writs from courts outside the district, is normally\\ndone through the magisterial elements of the district administration. He supervises the\\nsubordinate magistracy and orders magisterial postings when required.\\nThe District Jail is under his general control. He can visit the Jail from time to time to see\\nthat all is well and ensure the expeditious disposal of cases of under-trial prisoners. He\\ndeals with different problems connected with the Jail administration.\\n34.8.3 Co-ordinator of Different Departments/Offices\\nFormerly , the district collector used to be the coordinating agency in overall char ge of\\nevery important of ficial activity in the district. After independence, several departments of\\ntechnical nature were setup. For example public health, public works, agriculture, irrigation,\\neducation and cooperation. These are headed by specialists and are not under the supervision\\nof the collector . These have their own progrmames of development which they conduct on\\ntheir own without the interference of the collector . This has to some extent, weakend the\\ncollectors role as a coordinating agency . Inspite of this, the entire team in a district has to\\nwork with a sense of dedication in the same manner as a soldier on the battle front. The\\ndistrict officer is still the commander who has to organize and coordinate the different\\ndepartments and achieve the tar get which must be clearly laid down. To emer ge as a\\nsuccessful coordinator , the collector must give each agency breathing space, remove bottle\\nnecks, invoke the trust of the various departments in himself and bring out unity of purpose.\\n34.8.4 Crisis Management\\nDuring emergencies such as those caused by natural calamities, floods, famines, cyclones,\\netc. or man made crises such as riots, fires, or external aggression, it is he who holds an\\numbrella over the district. He also enforces civil defense measures, is responsible for the\\nprotection of vital installations, prevents panic and performs a host of other crucial functions.\\n34.8.5 Development Functions\\nHe has become a pivotal figure in the implementation of development programmes. In\\nmany states, he is also designated as the District Development Of ficer. He is made\\nresponsible for both regulatory and development administration. The great influence that\\nthe collector wields in the district should be harnessed to the task of development. His\\ndevelopment role has become a focal point after the initiation of development planning in\\nIndia. Several programmes for the welfare and benefit of the down-trodden have been\\nstarted by the government. Rural development programmes aimed at eradicating poverty\\nand improving the living standards of the poor have gained significance after 1970s. As\\nsuch, now the emphasis is on his leadership role in the extension and development activity\\nof the district. He is the ex-officio chairman of the district rural development agency\\n(DRDA). His role in rural development has also to be viewed in terms of his position in\\nand relationship with the Zilla Parishads. This role has been changing and a balance has\\nbeen resorted between the autonomy of the Zilla Parishad and the powers of the collector .\\nAgain the 73rd and 74th amendments and the enactments on Panchayati Raj by various\\nstates in 1993 and early 1994 have changed the role and the responsibilities of the collector\\nwith regard to developmental activities.'),\n",

We no longer live in simple Greek city-states or tiny Indian republics. Society\\nhas become more complex today . Accordingly , the government has become a huge\\ncomplicated machinery which can be serviced and run only by a distinct group of officials\\nknown as bureaucracy . Some scholars have even given bureaucracy the status of “the\\nfourth or gan of the government”. Therefore, bureaucracy cannot be wished away .\\nMax Weber, the German social scientist who was the first to make a systematic study of\\nbureaucracy , described it as rational and the most ef ficient form of or ganisation. He\\ndescribed an ideal-type of bureaucracy as one characterized by:\\n1. Officials organised in fixed jurisdictional areas,\\n2.

It is a pre requisite of modernization\\nof every society . Most developing countries are engaged in the process of nation building\\nand bringing about rapid socio-economic development, i.e., providing social services such\\nas health, education, infrastructure like roads, electricity , productive activities in agriculture,\\nindustry etc. The complex of such formidable activities connected with the development\\nenterprise is essentially government’ s responsibility . Here, public administration becomes\\nthe key agency of development. Bureaucracy can immensely contribute to development\\nby serving as an adviser , as an inventor , and a decision-maker . It can vitalize administration\\nby building up a social environment emphasizing responsibility by creating incentives, by\\nencouraging healthy competition and self-development, by organizing institutional\\nmanagement under competent and progressive leadership and by delegating authority to\\nlower levels for maximizing development.\\nBureaucracy constitutes the apparatus and mechanism through which the state realizes its\\npurposes. It has been rightly said that a country’ s life is lar gely shaped by the quality of\\nadministration. A plan can succeed only if its administrative implications have been worked\\nout in detail. Hence, a high degree of bureaucratic competence is essential to push through\\nspeedy development measures. In most developing countries, the problem is not the inability\\nof the governments to devise rational programmes for development, but their incapacity to\\ncarry them out.\\nIntext Questions 35.2\\nFill in the blanks :\\na) _________ is the main mechanism through which the state implements its\\ndevelopment programmes.\\nb) Bureaucracy no longer performs only _________ functions. It performs _________\\nfunctions too.\\n35.3 Bureaucracy and Politics\\n35.3.1 Politics / Administration Dichotomy\\nThe conventional view of public administration is based upon the dichotomy of politics and\\nadministration i.e. administration and politics should be kept separate. Politics or policy\\nmaking is the proper activity of the legislative bodies and administration is the proper\\nactivity of administrators who carry out policies. It is opposed to any political role of the\\ncivil servants. It visualizes the relationship between the administrator and the politician in\\nterms of a neat division of labour – the politician formulates the policy and the administrator\\nexecutes it. The bureaucrat acts as pure adviser to his political master , presents facts of\\nthe case, suggests lines of action and implications of alternative policies. It is the prerogative\\nof the political master to decide the policy . The bureaucrat is expected to implement the\\npolicy faithfully , whatever the decision. He is to be anonymous and neutral in the dischar ge\\nof his duty . He is expected to render impartial advice without fear or favour . The doctrine\\nof neutrality and anonymity has been one of the fundamental tenets of the Weberian'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Hp\\\\Documents\\\\vscode\\\\prepbridge\\\\prepbridge\\\\data\\\\indian-polity.pdf', 'page': 376}, page_content='Notes\\n375Political Executive and BureaucracyOPTIONAL MODULE - 2\\nAdministrative System\\nin Indiamodel of bureaucracy . It insulates the bureaucrat from any politicization and makes him\\nprofessional in his outlook.\\nThe planners in India too subscribed to the Weberian ideal of neutral civil service. In our\\ncountry , the Civil Service Conduct Rules prohibit the government employees from active\\nparticipation in political activities. Except for the limited right of voting in secret, a government\\nemployee cannot participate in any way in any political movement or activity including\\nelection campaigns. He cannot join a political party even as an inactive member or contribute\\nfinancially to its funds; he cannot express any opinion on political issues; and he cannot\\nstand for election to any legislature.\\nAn impersonal, strictly rule-bound, neutral bureaucracy was expected not only to provide\\nthe necessary administrative objectivity but also enhance the democratic principle of equality\\nand provide protection from arbitrary rule.\\n35.3.2 Decline of Neutrality Concept\\nThe traditional concept of neutrality , however , has been challenged on many grounds. The\\nearlier concept of separation of politics and administration in watertight compartments is\\nconsidered no more valid. The role of the Civil Service has been changing from being a\\nmere agent of the political executive to that of collaboration with it. The involvement of\\nbureaucracy in political arena is now widely prevalent.\\nThe breakdown of the theory of neutrality has come about because of a number of reasons.\\nFirstly , the processes of policy making are no longer confined to the political executive.\\nThe truth is that the bureaucrats play an important role in policy formulation, perceived to\\nbe the exclusive preserve of elected politicians. This has happened because the statutes\\npassed by the parliament are not clear enough. The legislative behaviour follows no consistent\\npattern. Whereas, some measures are too detailed, some only identify the problem. The\\nminister is rarely an expert in the work of his department or the techniques of public\\nadministration. He merely has general ideas in line with the political ideology of his party ,\\nbut he often is not sure what is the best solution to a particular problem. He is therefore,\\nforced to rely on his permanent staff for facts and advice. In effect then, it is the\\nadministrator who has a major role in framing the policy .\\nSecondly , the decline of neutrality can be attributed to the demands and pressures of\\ncoalition politics. In coalition governments, ministers are busy in the power game and\\nmaneuvering for their survival, and have neither time nor inclination to guide, direct and\\ncontrol their department or bureaucracy . Also at times, the legislative process is so stormy\\nand full of diverse views that a statute passed incorporates a number of a contradictory\\npolicy guidelines. The necessity of reaching a compromise solution to hold the coalition\\ntogether leads the legislators to use vague language and the administrator has to use his\\nown judgement to interpret the policy . Therefore, bureaucracy has clearly made inroads in\\npolicy making and despite the regulations governing the civil servants they have been\\npoliticized considerably .\\nThirdly , according to some political commentators, the classical theory of civil service\\nneutrality presupposes agreement on principles fundamental to democracy . In other words,\\nneutral, value-free bureaucracy is possible only in a society where consensus exists on\\nvalues; but in transitional societies like India, where dissent and conflict exist, it is too\\nmuch to expect anyone to be neutral.'),\n",

The involvement of civil servants in numerous decisions be it the location of\\na steel plant or a school building in a village, makes them partners in development along\\nwith the politicians. Their value preferences get inextricably mixed up with technical advice.\\nIn the context of large-scale welfare programmes therefore, neutrality is not possible. In\\nfact a certain commitment to the goals and objectives of the state on the part of bureaucracy\\nis inescapable. Neutrality cannot be allowed to degenerate into disinterestedness. The\\nsuccessful carrying out of developmental tasks requires on the part of administrators not\\nonly qualities of initiative and leadership but also a sense of emotional integration with the\\npolicies and programmes and identification with the interests of the common man. The\\nidea of bureaucracy as a neutral instrument in the conduct of public affairs thus stands\\nrefuted.\\n35.3.3 Committed Bureaucracy\\nWeber’s model of bureaucracy was found inappropriate to ef fect the social transformation\\nin many developing countries. In India, it received a good amount of criticism for its failure\\nto meet the growing demands of social legislation. After two decades of independence,\\nMrs. Indira Gandhi, the then Prime Minister , advocated the concept of committed\\nbureaucracy . Not only did she express her dissatisfaction with the performance of\\nbureaucracy , she expressed doubt about the relevance of the basic assumptions underlying\\nthe Indian bureaucracy that of neutrality , impartiality , anonymity etc. and she alleged that\\nthe bureaucrats lacked commitment. She disgustingly referred to the administrative\\nmachinery as ‘the stumbling block in the country’ s progress’  and reiterated the necessity\\nof creating an administrative cadre committed to national objectives and responsive to\\nIndian social needs. She found in ‘committed bureaucracy’ the answer to the ills of neutrality\\nthat crippled the development process in India. She had an earnest belief that only a\\ncommitted bureaucracy can bring about the desired change.\\nThe concept of ‘committed bureaucracy’ was much contested in the political and\\nadministrative circles. It was alleged that it would permanently damage the fabric of the\\nservices. It would create a breed of pliable civil servants who would always say “Y es\\nMinister” and would be ready to crawl when asked to bend by their political masters. It\\nwas also alleged that in the name of commitment the ruling party was seeking bureaucracy’ s\\nalignment with the party’ s ideology in order to perpetuate its rule. However , it was later\\nclarified by the government that commitment did not mean attachment to the ideology of\\nthe party in power , but a commitment to the development of the country and personal\\ninvolvement of bureaucracy in the tasks as opposed to ostrich like withdrawal and isolation\\nfrom politics.\\nThus, if committed bureaucracy stands for a non-partisan, socially sensitive civil service,\\nwhich can empathize with the politician who is genuinely , interested in progress and\\ndevelopment of the country , then a committed civil service is more appropriate for a\\ndeveloping nation than having an insensitive neutral one.\\nIntext Questions 35.3\\nFill in the blanks :\\na) Conventional view of public administration is based upon the dichotomy of _________'),\n",

Commitment to social  objectives is one thing and dancing to the tune of a\\npolitical party is another . Very often it is seen that bureaucracy simply acts according to\\nthe dictates of the political executive without any independent examination of issues. This\\ntrend can be attributed to the ever-growing political interference in the affairs of\\nadministration. Political interference and impartial administration cannot co-exist.\\nWhile the administrators do not perceive their role in policy making as subservient to the\\npolitical leaders because of their knowledge and expertise, yet they have to conform to the\\nprerequisites of representative politics. The political leaders claim to be the true\\nrepresentatives of the people and know what is good for them and because of their superior\\nposition succeed in dictating the terms to the bureaucrats. The bureaucrats who are not\\nobliging enough soon find themselves in trouble. The political masters have many means\\nof coercion – both overt and covert. Political interference in all matters including those\\nwhere the statutory power is vested in the civil servants is a constant phenomenon. There\\nare numerous instances of use of transfer , promotion, supercession and compulsory\\nretirement from service by elected politicians as tools to silence the voice of dissent and\\nexpression of difference of opinion.\\nWell, politicization works the other way round also. Many administrators use political\\ninfluence or forge alliance with the politician to brighten their own career prospects. They\\ntake advantage of the amateur politician; exploit his weakness particularly in times of a\\nfluid political situation and turn out to be autonomous and irresponsible. This is an equally\\ngrim scenario.\\nWhat emerges out of the analysis is that whether there is collision or collusion between the\\npolitical executive and the bureaucracy , in both cases it leads to or ganizational imbalance\\nand ultimately the governa nce suffers.'),\n",

The two most\\nimportant areas touched upon by the ARC in its reports were: (a) Minister – Civil Servants\\nrelationship, wherein the ARC emphasized the need for the de-politicization of the services,\\nand (b) the creation of a climate and culture of administration that would help assert the\\ngrowth of unhealthy personal relationship between Civil Servants and Minister .\\nThe ARC took cognizance of the fact that proper relationship between the political executive\\nand bureaucracy is a matter of highest importance to the administrative performance of\\ngovernment. It observed that the existing pattern of relationship was different from what\\nwas envisaged. More and more cases of deviation were coming to notice. For instance\\nthe extent of bureaucratic involvement in politics was exceptionally high, there was frequent\\nuse of transfers and postings to manipulate bureaucracy , there was unholy nexus between\\npoliticians and bureaucracy etc. which was taking its toll on administrative ef ficiency .\\nTherefore, corrective measures were required to restore the health of the system.\\nThe ARC stressed the ur gency to prevent bureaucracy’ s aggressive role in politics and\\nalso a need to check arbitrary interference of politicians in administrative affairs. It believed\\nthat both Minister and Civil Servants must appreciate rather than belittle each other ’s\\nwork and attempt maximum accommodation of one another ’s views. On the part of the\\npolitical executive there should be, in the words of the ARC,\\n(a) a proper understanding of the administrative functions and recognition of its professional\\nnature.\\n(b) as little interference as possible in service matters, e.g. postings, transfers, promotions\\netc.\\n(c ) no requests for departures from declared and approved policies to suit individual\\ncases.\\nSimilarly , on the part of the civil service it asserts :\\n(a) there must be a sincere and honest attempt to find out what the political head wants\\nand make the necessary adjustment in policies and procedures to suit his wishes.\\n(b) readiness to fall in line with his political chief in all matters, unless strong grounds\\nindicate a different course.\\nIn other words, it means an emotional and mental acceptance by the bureaucracy of the\\nideology of the government policy to be executed by it.\\n35.5.1 Recent Developments\\nInspite of the valuable recommendations made by the ARC to streamline the relationship\\nbetween the minister and the civil servants, nothing much seems to have changed because\\nof political and administrative apathy . Making the matters worse is the growth in recent\\ntimes of a nexus between the politicians, criminals, police and the civil servants rooted in\\nthe considerations of “mutuality of benefit”. An increasing use of money and muscle'),\n",

Since the muscle\\npower is mostly provided by the mafia and the criminals, a close nexus has come to prevail\\nbetween the politicians and the criminals resulting in “criminalization of politics”. This has\\nbeen the main conclusion of the Vohra Committee Report of 1993 submitted by the then\\nHome Secretary , Mr. N.N. Vohra which was set up to look into the criminalization of\\npolitics. The report observed that the mafia and the criminals enjoyed the patronage of\\npoliticians and the protection of government functionaries. It pointed out how the nexus\\nwas virtually running a parallel government, pushing the state apparatus into irrelevance.\\nHere the two elites – political and administrative, join hands and become not only thick\\nfriends but also grand thieves. Such a nexus is detrimental to public interest.\\nTherefore, it was felt that corrective steps must be taken to ensure that this evil nexus is\\ncurbed. With this objective in mind, the Prime Minister inaugurated a Conference of Chief\\nSecretaries in November 1996 on ‘An Agenda for an Ef fective and Responsive\\nAdministration. The Conference emphasized the need for bringing about transformation in\\npublic services so as to make them more ef fective, clean, accountable and citizen friendly .\\nThe Conference also highlighted the necessity of adopting the code of ethics for public\\nservices which not only regulates the role of the civil servants but also specifies the\\nrelationship between the employees in public services and politicians, so that the basic\\ncommitment of the civil servants towards the welfare of the public and the principles\\nenshrined in the Constitution is reiterated. We only hope that the implementation of the\\nproposed Action Plan will be ef fective.\\nTo conclude, a developing nation cannot af ford contradictory ethos between the political\\nexecutive and bureaucracy because it strikes at the root of a progressive administrative\\nculture. The roles of political and administrative elite are complimentary and in the interest\\nof public welfare they must work in harmony with each other .\\nWhat You Have Learnt\\nPolitical executive and bureaucracy are the two pillars of the government. Whereas political\\nexecutive is temporary and usually represent the party in power , bureaucracy is a permanent\\nfixture. Theoretically they play different roles, for instance, politicians make policies and\\nadministrators implement them. But, in practice their roles often conflict and overlap because\\nthe line separating development of policy and its implementation is quite blurred and hazy .\\nBureaucracy is a body of permanent, paid and skilled officials. It aids and advises the\\ngovernment to make plans and carry them out. The role of bureaucracy has changed. It\\nno longer performs only the regulatory functions but actively engages in development and\\nwelfare activities. Conventional image of civil servant has been that of an anonymous\\nservant of the minister who is committed to efficient discharge of his duties and who\\noffers his sincere advice to his master , irrespective of his political ideology . This advice\\nmay or may not be accepted by the minister , but once the decision is made, he is duty\\nbound to implement it ef fectively .\\nThis concept of anonymous and neutral bureaucracy was considered impractical and\\nunsuited to meet the goals of social justice. Therefore, Mrs. Gandhi sought a ‘Committed\\nBureaucracy’. But commitment has degenerated into politicization of bureaucracy and\\nthe relationship between political executive and bureaucracy has deteriorated.'),\n",

Government\\nis operated by bureaucracy for whom the rules and regulations are more important than\\nhelping the citizens. Also, it tends to keep things secret and department like electricity and\\nwater -supply , railways and telephones etc. exercise their own power . Citizens register\\nmany complaints against government machinery . The grievances of citizens against\\ngovernment machinery need to be heard and redressed otherwise, citizens will tend to\\nwithdraw their loyalty towards it. Hence, democracy sets up appropriate machineries for\\nthe redressal of citizen’ s grievances.\\nObjectives\\nAfter studying this lesson, you will able to\\n/circle6 recognise the importance of redressal of public grievances in a democracy;\\n/circle6 identify and explain various instruments of redressal of public grievances;\\n/circle6 explain the role of Lokpal and Lokayukta;\\n/circle6 understand the role and working of Central Vigilance Commission.\\n36.1 Importance of Redressal of Grievances in a Democracy\\nIn a developing country like ours, Government has to perform many functions. The citizens\\ndepend on the services provided by various government agencies. To levy rice, wheat and\\nsugar from a ration shop, a citizen has to have a ration card issued by the Government. To\\nobtain a ration card is not very dif ficult, but the quality of services is far from satisfactory .\\nFor most things in life, citizens depend on the services and facilities provided by government\\nagencies.\\nIt is a common experience that the citizens often face difficulties in dealing with government\\nagencies. Too many rules and regulations are there, resulting in unncessary delay . Trains\\nor buses may not run on time. The banks, the hospitals, the police are often not co-operative.I'),\n",

At the same time,  it has to be accepted that government\\nhas to undertake many functions in the interest of the public. The difficulties that the\\nmembers of the public face in getting services, make the people unhappy and dissatisfied.\\nThe poor people suffer most. They badly need government support and services, but they\\nare the ones who are often harassed and turned down. This is obviously bad for the\\nhealthy democracy . The average citizen wants sympathetic, courteous and helpful public\\nadministration. If there are too many public grievances against the government agencies,\\ncorrective measures have to be taken to redress those grievances.\\nThe Administrative Reforms Commission was set up by the Government of India in 1966.\\nOn the “Problems of Redress of Citizens’ Grievances”, the commission said the following:\\n“When the citizen can establish the genuineness of his case, it is plainly the duty of the\\nstate to set right the wrong done to him. An institution for redress of grievances must be\\nprovided within the democratic system of government. It has to be an institution in which\\nthe average citizen will have faith and confidence and through which he will be able to\\nsecure quick and inexpensive justice”.\\n36.2 Instruments of Redressal of Grievances\\nTo deal with administrative-corruption and to redress citizens’  grievances, simplification of\\nrules and procedures has been suggested and carried on in practice. Besides these, new\\ninstitutions have also been recommended and actually set up in many countries.\\nCreated for the redressal of public grievances, the institution of  “Ombudsman” is typically\\nScandinavian. The office of Ombudsman has been in existence in Sweden since 1809 and\\nin Finland since 1919. Denmark introduced the system in 1955. Norway and New Zealand\\nadopted it in 1962, and the United Kingdom appointed the Parliamentary Commissioner\\nfor Administration in 1967. Several countries in the world have since adopted the\\nOmbudsman-like institution.\\nOmbudsman, a Swedish word, stands for an officer appointed by the legislature to handle\\ncomplaints against administrative and judicial action. As an impartial investigator , the\\nombudsman makes investigations, gets at the facts objectively , and reports back to the\\nlegislature. The complainant has simply to write to the ombudsman appealing against an\\nadministrative decision. The ombudsman system has been popular because of its simple\\nand speedy nature. It is a cheap method of handling appeals against administrative decisions.\\nWhen a citizen or consumer finds good and service defective he/she can take the shelter\\nof Consumer Protection Act enacted in 1986. The Right to Information Act (R TI) has also\\nbeen passed by the Parliament of our country to know what has happened in regard to his/\\nher complaint.\\nIndian Instrumentation\\nIn India, it has been observed by many committees and commissions that special machinery\\nshould be set up to deal with public complaints against the administration. Various institutions'),\n",

For instance, a citizen can move the court to seek\\nremedy against any wrong done to him by a public servant or a public agency in the course\\nof dischar ge of public duty: This is called Judicial remedy . Many kinds of administrative\\ntribunals have been set up to provide cheap and speedy justice to the complainant. The\\nIncome Tax Appellate Tribunal, Labour Tribunals etc. are instances of this type of institution.\\nSecondly , Parliamentar y procedur e provides for opportunities to raise questions in\\nParliament by the elected representatives concerning their constituencies. Also, there is a\\nParliamentary Committee called the Committee on Petitions. A citizen may submit petitions\\nto secure redress against an act of injustice. So, even though a distant body , Parliament or\\nState Legislature can take up the cause of an aggrieved citizen.\\nThirdly , under the provisions of the Public Servants (Enquiries) Act, depar tmental as\\nwell as public agencies can be instituted against a public servant for his misconduct. Not\\nday-to-day dealing but more serious matter of maladministration come under the purview\\nof this Act.\\nFourthly , complaint forums have been set up at dif ferent levels to deal with public complaints.\\nFor example, in a public bus or in a railway station, there are complaint boxes to receive\\ncomplaints from public. Consumers’ Fora are now available to deal with complaints against\\nany supplier of goods and services such as telephone services. Within lar ge public\\norganization such as Railways and Telecommunication etc., there are complaint cells to\\ndeal with public complaints.\\nThe government has also created Department of Adminstrative Reforms and Public\\nGrievances. This is the nodal agency of the government for Administrative Reforms as\\nwell as redressal of public grievances.\\nThe enactment of Administrative Tribun al Act 1985 opened a new chapter in the sphere of\\nadministrating jus tice to the aggrieved gov ernment servant and in some cases public members.\\nIntext Questions 36.1\\n1.

They have not been very\\nsuccessful to provide effective redressal of an individual citizens’ grievance against\\ngovernment agencies and political leadership. Against this background, the Administrative\\nReforms Commission (ARC, 1966) made the following observation:\\n“We are of the view that the special circumstances relating to our country can be fully\\nmet, by providing for two special institutions for the redressal of citizens’ grievances.\\nThere should be one authority for dealing with complaints against the administrative acts\\nof ministers or secretaries to government both at the centre and in the states. There should\\nbe another authority in each state and the centre for dealing with complaints against the\\nadministrative acts of other of ficials. All these authorities should be independent of the\\nexecutive as well as the legislature and judiciary”. The ARC called the first authority the\\nLokpal and the second authority the Lokayukta.\\nInspite of several attempts the Lokpal Bill has again and again fallen through in Parliament.\\nIt appears that both the Congress; and non-Congress Governments have not been sincere\\nand serious enough about the enactment of the Lokpal Bill despite their public\\npronouncements to that effect and promise to give to the people a clean administration,\\nThere are two fundamental issues involved. Firstly , there is clearly the hidden unwillingness\\nof political leadership to submit themselves for enquiry by an independent authority other\\nthan Parliament to which they are already responsible in a parliamentary democracy .\\nSecondly , the functional jurisdiction of the proposed Lokpal is also debatable. Should the\\nLokpal take up the cases of corruption only or it should also be entrusted with the task of\\nredressing citizens’ grievances in respect of injustice caused by maladministration of\\nofficials. The citizen is interested in redressal of his little problems and individual grievances\\nbut the existing avenues do not provide him easy , speedy and cheap redressal. Hence,\\nwhat is needed is an agency , independent of government control, to redress the common\\ngrievances of people.\\nThe Lokayukta\\nAlthough no institution of Lokpal has yet been established at the Centre, there are states\\nlike Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Bihar , Orissa, Himachal Pradesh\\nand National Capital Territory of Delhi which have appointed Lokayukta for dealing with\\nthe public grievances on the lines suggested by the ARC. Maharashtra was the first state\\nto enact such legislation in 1971. The other state legislations were based more or less on\\nthe Maharashtra lines which provide the Lolkayukta with exclusive powers to look into\\ncomplaints against state ministers, secretaries and other senior officers. Section 12 of the\\nHimachal Pradesh Lokayukta Act, 1983, provides, “If, after enquiry in respect of a\\ncomplaint, the Lokayukta is satisfied that all or any of the allegations made in the complaint\\nhave or have been substantiated either wholly or partly , he shall, by report in writing,'),\n",

The\\ncompetent authority examines the report and has to communicate to the lokayukta within\\na period of three months of the receipt of such report, the action taken thereon. It may be\\nnoted that the Lokayukta is only a recommending authority . Its recommendations have no\\nlegal sanctity , nor are these binding. The final judgement in respect of the of fence lies with\\nthe competent government authority .\\n36.4 The Central Vigilance Commission\\nBeing alarmed at increasing rate of corruption; a high-power committee was set up by\\nGovernment of India in 1962 under the Chairmanship of K. Santhanam. The Santhanam\\nCommittee recommended, setting up of Vigilance Commissions at the Centre and in the\\nvarious S tates. Vigilance Cells have since been created in several government departments\\nand public sector undertakings. At the highest level there is a Central Vigilance Commission\\n(CVC).\\nThe CVC is headed by the Central Vigilance Commissioner , appointed by the President of\\nIndia, for a period of six years or until he attains the age of 65 years, whichever is earlier .\\nThe Commission’ s office is located in the Ministry of Home Affairs having an autonomous\\nstatus. In addition to the Commissioner , it consists of a Secretary , one Of ficer on Special\\nDuty , one Chief Technical Commissioner , 3 Commissioners for departmental enquiries, 2\\nUnder Secretaries and 6 Technical Commissioners. Its  jurisdiction extends to all employees\\nof the central government and the employees in public undertakings, corporate bodies and\\nother organisations dealing with matters falling within the executive powers of the central\\ngovernment. However , it cannot probe cases of corruption against ministers and members\\nof parliament .\\nThe CVC receives complaints directly from the aggrieved party . It also gathers information\\nabout corruption and malpractices or misconduct from other sources such as press reports,\\naudit objections, information through parliamentary debates and other forms etc. The\\ncomplaints about Central Government employees received by the S tate Vigilance\\nCommissions are forwarded by them to the CVC. On receiving complaints, the Commission\\nmay ask:\\n(i) the concerned ministry/department to inquire into them;\\n(ii) the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to make an inquiry; and\\n(iii) the CBI direction to register a case and conduct an investigation. Prosecution, however ,\\ndepends on the approval by the appropriate sanctioning authority .\\nThe CVC has laid clown procedures to be followed by the administrative ministries/\\ndepartments in the case of complaints received by them. These complaints are to be dealt\\nwith by the ministries/departments concerned. The CVC may advise the ministries/\\ndepartments in respect of all matters relating to integrity in administration. It may also call\\nfor reports, returns or statements from all ministries/departments so as to enable it, to\\nexercise a general check and supervision over vigilance and anti-corruption work in the'),\n",

It can also take over under its direct control any complaint or case\\nfor further action.\\nBesides these, the CVC has a role to play in the case of the appointment of Chief Vigilance\\nOfficer of each ministry/department. The CVC is to be consulted before giving such an\\nappointment. Moreover , the CVC has been empowered to assess the work of the Chief\\nVigilance Of ficer. This assessment is recorded in the character rolls of the of ficers. Finally ,\\nall proposals for re-or ganising or strengthening the Vigilance Or ganisation by the Chief\\nVigilance Of ficers are to be referred to the CVC for scrutiny .\\nThe role of CVC is, however , limited because it is not a statutory commission and has only\\nadvisory role. Further , the procedure of investigation is so vexatious that people do not\\ndesire to be involved in long and unpleasant proceedings. Thus it has been commented that\\nthe Central Vigilance Commission is not at all a substitute for an Ombudsman. As it is\\nconstituted, the Commission is virtually an extension of the bureaucratic apparatus of the\\nCentral Government and its operations are very much hedged in by the overpowering\\nministries/departments and the political forces at the Centre.\\nIntext Questions 36.2\\n1.
